    <Story>
      Unlike other foxes that roamed the woods of southern Ionia, Ahri had always felt a strange connection to the magical world around her; a connection that was somehow incomplete. Deep inside, she felt the skin she had been born into was an ill fit for her and dreamt of one day becoming human. Her goal seemed forever out of reach, until she happened upon the wake of a human battle. It was a grisly scene, the land obscured by the forms of wounded and dying soldiers. She felt drawn to one: a robed man encircled by a waning field of magic whose life was quickly slipping away. She approached him and something deep inside of her triggered, reaching out to the man in a way she couldn't understand. His life essence poured into her, carried on invisible strands of magic. The sensation was intoxicating and overwhelming. As her reverie faded, she was delighted to discover that she had changed. Her sleek white fur had receded and her body was long and lithe, the shape of the humans who lay scattered about her.
      \n\n
      However, though she appeared human, she knew that in truth the transformation was incomplete. A cunning creature, she adapted herself to the customs of human society and used her profound gift of beauty to attract unsuspecting men. She could consume their life essences when they were under the spell of her seductive charms. Feeding on their desires brought her closer to her dream, but as she took more lives, a strange sense of regret began to well within her. She had reservations about actions which never troubled her as a fox. She realized that she could not overcome the pangs of her evolving morality. In search of a solution, Ahri found the Institute of War, home of the most gifted mages on Runeterra. They offered her a chance to attain her humanity without further harm through service in the League of Legends.

    <Story>There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated to the preservation of balance. Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world. Akali is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Pruning the Tree - eliminating those who threaten the equilibrium of Valoran. \n\nA prodigal martial artist, Akali began training with her mother as soon as she could make a fist. Her mother's discipline was relentless and unforgiving, but predicated on the fundamental principle: ''We do that which must be done.'' When the Kinkou inducted her into the order at the age of fourteen, she could slice a dangling chain with a chop of her hand.  There was no question - she would succeed her mother as the Fist of Shadow. She has had to do much in this role which others might find morally questionable, but to her it is in service of her mother's inviolable doctrine. She now works with her fellows Shen and Kennen to enforce the balance of Valoran. This hallowed pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.\n\n''The Fist of Shadow strikes from the cover of death itself. Do not impede the balance.''</Story>

  <Champion name="Alistar" title="The Minotaur" range="125" gender="m" rp="585" ip="1350" abilityVideoID="0012">
    <Story>As the mightiest warrior to ever emerge from the Minotaur tribes of the Great Barrier, Alistar defended his tribe from Valoran's many dangers; that is, until the coming of the Noxian army. Alistar was lured from his village by the machinations of Keiran Darkwill, General Boram Darkwill's youngest son and commander of the Noxian expeditionary force. When Alistar returned, he found his village burning and his family slain. Bellowing with rage, he charged an entire regiment of Noxus' elite, slaughtering them by the hundreds. Only the intervention of some of Noxus' most skilled summoners checked Alistar's rage. Brought in chains to Noxus, Alistar spent the intervening years as a gladiator in the Fleshing, pitted in endless battle for the entertainment of Noxus' wealthy leaders.\n\nAlistar's once noble soul slowly became twisted, and he would have been driven to insanity if not for Ayelia, a young servant girl who befriended him and eventually arranged for his escape. Suddenly free, Alistar joined the newly formed League of Legends to fight as a champion, hoping to one day exact his final vengeance upon Noxus and find the girl who had renewed his hope. Initially unwilling to cater to his celebrity status as a champion, Alistar has since discovered that there is power in fame, and he has become a vocal advocate for those whom the Noxian government treads upon. He also calls to light things that the Noxian military would prefer remain hidden -- something that has made him very unpopular with Noxus' nobles. His charitable work has earned him several philanthropic awards, which serve as an interesting contrast to the rage and destruction he brings to the League of Legends.\n\nIf you intend to grab the bull by the horns as a summoner, Alistar might have something to say about that.</Story>

  <Champion name="Amumu" title="The Sad Mummy" range="125" gender="m" rp="585" ip="1350" abilityVideoID="0032">
    <Story>Perhaps one of the oddest champions in the League of Legends is the yordle known as Amumu. His life before joining the League remains unknown... especially to Amumu. All he remembers is that he woke up alone inside a pyramid within the Shurima Desert. He was entwined in mummy wrappings and he could not feel his heart beat. Furthermore, he felt a deep sadness that he could not entirely explain; he knew he missed his parents, though he could not remember who they were. Dropping to his knees, Amumu wept into his bandages. No matter what he did, it seemed he could never stop his tears or sadness. Eventually he stood up, determined to wander the world to discover his past. Amumu traveled all across southern Valoran - a feat that is not easily dismissed.\n\nWhile Amumu still hasn't learned much about his past, he has learned a great deal about who he has become. He is most assuredly undead, though he harbors none of the evil characteristics typical of undead beings. He also seems to keep trouble at arm's length; Amumu was able to traverse all of Southern Valoran without so much as a single bad thing happening to him. He was just sad, and the people and beings he encountered eventually shared his sadness. Ultimately, he made his way north across the Great Barrier to the Institute of War, the home of the League. Amumu's story was compelling to the summoners he met there, and they invited him to take part in a League Judgment. His success within the League as a champion has given Amumu something he desired: a home. With his present (un)life secured, he now hopes the friends he has made will help him discover his past. \n\n''Things are bad when Amumu is crying, but they're much worse when he's angry.'' - Ezreal</Story>

  <Champion name="Anivia" title="The Cryophoenix" range="600" gender="f" rp="975" ip="3150" spotlight="8Syose1O568" abilityVideoID="0034">
    <Story>In most lore, the phoenix is a creature of fire that rises from its own ashes. What few know, however, is that phoenixes are elemental beings, formed by the eternal essences of their native world. Anivia was conceived on a world such as this - a being of the coldest winter, a creature of pure elemental ice. On her world, Anivia was the protector of the frozen wastes and all those with the spirit to endure in such unforgiving places. She was consulted as a creature of great wisdom, one who could not die and who had seen the world renewed several times. Somehow, Anivia knew that the day would come when she would be plucked from her home and pulled across worlds, and when that day came, she received the call with grace. Seeing the imbalance and injustice on Runeterra, a world lacking elemental protectors, Anivia took her place at the League of Legends.\n\nSince her arrival, the Cryophoenix has chosen to live among the highest peaks of the Northern Ironspike Mountains, adjacent to the frozen wastes of Freljord. She has openly claimed this territory as her own protectorate. Surprisingly, Anivia has struck up a friendship with the yeti of this region - a friendship that grows deeper and deeper with each passing moon. She has formed a close bond with two League champions: Nunu (and Willump) and the nomad princess Ashe. In a move that caught the League by surprise, the Cryophoenix recently entreated the summoners of the Institute of War to research a means in bringing across others of her elemental fellows. As a champion, Anivia is revered with a sense of awe by most, but is not the most popular as most consider her unapproachable.\n\nSome say the world will end in fire, some in ice. Anivia awaits the inevitable latter.</Story>

  <Champion name="Annie" title="The Dark Child" range="625" gender="f" rp="260" ip="450" abilityVideoID="0001">
    <Story>In the time shortly before the League, there were those within the sinister city-state of Noxus who did not agree with the evils perpetrated by the Noxian High Command. The High Command had just put down a coup attempt from the self-proclaimed Crown Prince Raschallion, and a crack down on any form of dissent against the new government was underway. These political and social outcasts, known as the Gray Order, sought to leave their neighbors in peace as they pursued dark arcane knowledge. The leaders of this outcast society were a married couple: Gregori Hastur, the Gray Warlock, and his wife Amoline, the Shadow Witch. Together they led an exodus of magicians and other intelligentsia from Noxus, resettling their followers beyond the Great Barrier to the northern reaches of the unforgiving Voodoo Lands. Though survival was a challenge at times, the Gray Order's colony managed to thrive in a land where so many others would have failed.\n\nYears after the exodus, Gregori and Amoline had a child: Annie. Early on, Annie's parents knew there was something special about their daughter. At the age of two, Annie miraculously ensorcelled a shadow bear - a ferocious denizen of the petrified forests outside the colony - turning it into her pet. To this day she keeps her bear ''Tibbers'' by her side, often keeping him spellbound as a stuffed doll to be carried like a child's toy. The combination of Annie's lineage and the dark magic of her birthplace have given this little girl tremendous arcane power. It is this same girl who now finds herself as one of the most sought-after champions within the League of Legends - even by the city-state that would have exiled her parents had they not fled beforehand.\n\n''Annie may be one of the most powerful champions ever to have fought in a Field of Justice. I shudder to think of her capabilities when she becomes an adult.''  - High Councilor Kiersta Mandrake</Story>

  <Champion name="Ashe" title="The Frost Archer" range="600" gender="f" rp="260" ip="450" abilityVideoID="0022">
    <Story>One of the perennial favorites of summoners in the League of Legends is the Freljordian beauty known as Ashe. She is a direct descendant of Avarosa - one of three legendary sisters who each claimed dominion over the scattered tribes dwelling in the icy tundra of northern Valoran. Ashe mirrors her ancestor's unparalleled mastery of the bow, earning her the title of ''The Frost Archer'' the way Avarosa did during her era. Ashe is a literal Princess amongst her people, though she prefers to be addressed by outsiders as her tribal title rather than any form of royal moniker. There are those in Freljord, however, that would prefer to address Ashe as the ''late'' Frost Archer; the other two tribes that are descendants from the Three Sisters are historically sworn enemies of Ashe and her people. Having survived more than one assassination attempt in her life, Ashe is always aware of her surroundings regardless of where she is.\n\nAshe originally came to the Institute of War in service of the League summoners, seeking enough influence and favor to finally bring peace to her realm - one that has endured civil strife since Avarosa and the Time of the Three Sisters. With countless victories under her belt, she has started to put the influence she has earned in the League to use. Rumors abound that Ashe has begun to associate herself with fellow champion Tryndamere outside of the Fields of Justice. While she denies such talk as frivolous, all eyes will remain on Ashe now that her success in the League may finally allow her to restore lasting peace to her people.\n\n''It's a good idea to spread out. Ashe can hit five birds with one arrow.'' - Tryndamere</Story>

    <Story>The city of Zaun is a place where both magic and science have gone awry. The unchecked nature of experimentation has taken its toll on the city.  However, Zaun's lenient restrictions allow their researchers and inventors the leeway to push the bounds of science at an accelerated rate, for better or worse.  It was under these conditions that a team of doctoral students from Zaun's College of Techmaturgy made a breakthrough in the field of intelligent steam automation.  Their creation, the steam golem Blitzcrank, was developed to exercise judgment on-the-fly in order to assist with Zaun's hazardous waste reclamation process, since so often the conditions did not allow for human supervision.  However, he soon began exhibiting unforeseen behaviors.\n\nOver time, the scientists were able to identify a demonstrated learning process, and Blitzcrank fast became a celebrity.  As is sadly often the case though, credit for the golem's creation was scooped up by another - Professor Stanwick Pididly - though most now know the truth.  In the wake of the ensuing legal maelstrom, it became evident that neither party truly had the steam golem's best interests at heart, and Blitzcrank humbly petitioned for personal autonomy.  Backed by overwhelming support from the public, it took the liberal Council of Zaun only a few weeks to declare Blitzcrank a fully-independent, sentient entity.  A unique being, the golem left Zaun, distressed by the controversy and feeling there was no place he could fit in.  His travels led him to the one location in Valoran where unique beings have a place - the League of Legends.  Fortunately, he was easily able to adapt his design to suit the rigors he would face on the Fields of Justice.\n\nThough Blitzcrank may batter anything that stands in his way, he really has a heart of gold...encased in a framework of iron...in a carapace of steel.</Story>

    <Story>In a faraway place known as Lokfar there was a seafaring marauder called Kegan Rodhe. As was his people's way, Kegan sailed far and wide with his fellows, stealing treasures from those unlucky enough to catch their attention. To some, he was a monster; to others, just a man. One night, as they sailed through the arctic waters, strange lights danced over the frozen wastes. There was something hypnotic about them; it was something that drew them to it like moths to a flame. Trekking across the frozen waste, they came to a cave covered in ancient runes. The meaning of the runes long lost to them, Kegan led the way inside. There, inside a perfect cage of ice floated a dancing column of flame. There was no way such a thing should be burning, especially not in this place. However, its movement was as hypnotic as a siren's song, captivating and seductive. While the others stayed back, Kegan could not help but approach it while holding out his hand...\n\nThat is the last thing Kegan Rodhe remembers, for now his body belongs to Brand. It is a creature of olden times, perhaps even a casualty of the Rune Wars. It is known in ancient texts as the Burning Vengeance. It is a creature of pure fiery hate that exists for no other reason than to lay waste the world of men and yordles. No one is quite sure how Brand found his way to Valoran, but he began his predations at once. Overcome by Demacian forces, he was given a choice: fight within the confines of the League or die. Naturally, he chose to use his destructive powers in the League, for now...\n\n''This place will burn, not by cinder flying or breath of wind, but by the vengeance of my hand.''\n-Brand</Story>

    <Judgment date="8 April, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        The forest burns, blazing with the light of the sun. A lone figure stands amidst the conflagration, reveling in the blistering heat. It has been so long since he burned, so long since he watched the world fall to ashes under his power.
        \n\n
        It is ecstasy.
        \n\n
        He emerges from the flames. He can sense that nearby, over the next hill, there is life. People scramble, seeing the smoke from his inferno. Soon, they too will receive his gift of renewal.
        \n\n
        "Stop, in the name of the Kingdom of Demacia!"
        \n\n
        He turns. He is approached by a tall man in armor. The knight levels his sword, ready to strike if needs be. This man will soon discover that needs be.
        \n\n
        The man is followed by a blonde girl. Her armor has similarities to the man's. He can tell by her rod that she is a magician of some sort. He decides that she will have to be first.
        \n\n
        Then, another presence steps from the shadows. This one wears a cloak, its face buried deep within the hood. The stitching is alien to him, but he can recognize its arcane nature. He decides the girl will have to wait.
        \n\n
        He turns and unleashes a jet of burning vengeance at the hooded figure. Hands shoot up from inside the cloak, held in magical gestures. A shimmering shield blocks the flames, directing them harmlessly upward.
        \n\n
        "This is my last warning. Come peacefully, or face punishment!"
        \n\n
        He decides that the noises coming from the armored man's mouth do not contain enough searing agony. He turns and calls a pillar of flame to immolate the man. Again, a magical shield thwarts his efforts.
        \n\n
        Then, darkness...
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        He awakened. He lay in a pool of harsh light, descending from above. The floor was smooth, but he couldn't tell if this was a room or some magical trap. At this, his mind vaulted through his memories, to a very painful moment in the past.
        \n\n
        They had somehow devised a way to shackle him. Kneeling here on the snowy cave floor, the long-haired barbarians around him chanted words he barely understood. However, the icy cage ritualistically placed in the center of the cave told him everything he needed to know about his fate. He strained against the mystical chains that bound him, but to no avail. He shouted, screamed, and bellowed, trying to disrupt the concentration of his captors, but also to no avail.
        \n\n
        He could only wait as they ripped him from his mortal shell and trapped him inside the cage. Then, without words, the barbarians took their things and left. He was alone, and would remain so for more than a thousand years.
        \n\n
        He screamed in rage. His mind hurtled back to the present, once again encompassed by light.
        \n\n
        "So. You can be contained more permanently."
        \n\n
        He turned, immediately reaching out to burn the owner of the voice. However, his flames fizzled to nothing at the edge of the circle of light. He tried to leap toward the voice, but a force blocked him. Knocked back to the floor, he peered to see if his eyes could penetrate the darkness.
        \n\n
        "That ritual is long-lost, sorcerer. Your power cannot hold me forever."
        \n\n
        A figure stepped out from the darkness, the hooded magician from the forest.
        \n\n
        "We both know that isn't true."
        \n\n
        Again, his mind became dislodged from the moment, traveling back to a time before the ice barbarians imprisoned him. The body he wore was different, one of the simple herding folk of these farming lands. However, he still burned.
        \n\n
        The scene before him would have looked like the apocalypse to any mortal observer. To him, it was an image of absolute beauty. The countryside had been reduced to blackened ash. The nearby wooded hills were now nothing more than incinerated stumps and trunks. The charred bones of farmers and animals dotted the landscape, accompanied by the armored remains of the warriors who had futilely hoped to stop his renewal.
        \n\n
        The feeling that welled inside him could only be called one of profound satisfaction.
        \n\n
        Again, the present, the light.
        \n\n
        "You are a creature of destruction."
        \n\n
        Knowing that violence was no longer an option, he sat cross-legged in the pool of light and willed the flames that played across his body to burn even more brightly.
        \n\n
        "I am a creature of ever-lasting fire. I am a creature who burns away what needs to make way for what will be. I am a creature born to renew the world."
        \n\n
        The sorcerer began to walk, circling his cage.
        \n\n
        "You and I will have much time to talk in the days and weeks to come, so for the moment I will focus on the now. We cannot allow you to roam free. You are clearly far too dangerous for that. So, I offer you a choice."
        \n\n
        Weary of the sorcerer's voice behind him, he stood to track the pacing figure. The sorcerer continued.
        \n\n
        "You have two options. You may choose to be stripped from the body you wear and imprisoned indefinitely. Or, you may choose to remain under our control and fight in competitions where your abilities will be of use. That is the closest thing to freedom you will be afforded. These terms are not negotiable."
        \n\n
        Neither option was palatable to him.
        \n\n
        "These competitions, sorcerer. What are they?"
        \n\n
        "You would fight in the League of Legends, battling champions to settle our conflicts in place of open warfare."
        \n\n
        He mused for a moment, before sitting on the floor again.
        \n\n
        "I must think on your offer, sorcerer."
        \n\n
        The hooded man faded back into the shadows.
        \n\n
        "I am no sorcerer. You will address me by my proper title. Summoner. How shall I address you?"
        \n\n
        "I am known by many names," he replied. "But in this time, in your League of Legends, I believe Brand is fitting."
        \n\n
        And then, he was alone, given space to think. However, there was no thinking to be done. A leash was far better than an eternity caged.

  <Champion name="Caitlyn" title="The Sheriff of Piltover" range="650" gender="f" rp="790" ip="4800" spotlight="KFNFY6-gaDA" abilityVideoID="0051">
    <Story>One of the reasons Piltover is known as the City of Progress is because it has an extraordinarily low crime rate. This hasn't always been the case; brigands and thieves of all sorts used to find the city-state an ideal mark for plunder, primarily due to the valuable resources it imports to fuel its techmaturgical research. Some even theorize that it would have fallen long ago to the chaos of organized crime if not for Caitlyn, the Sheriff of Piltover. Born the daughter of a wealthy statesman and a pioneering hextech researcher, Caitlyn discovered her natural gift for investigation when, at age 14, her father was assaulted and robbed on his way home. She snuck out of her house that night with her father's rifle and tracked down the muggers from the crime scene. At first, her parents did their best to discourage her from such risky hobbies, but she was incorrigible. Wishing to protect her daughter in the only way she knew how, Caitlyn's mother began outfitting her with techmaturgical devices tailored to her sleuthing needs.\n\nCaitlyn quickly gained notoriety, both because she was single handedly defeating crime in Piltover and also because she soon developed into a ravishing beauty. She never backed down from a case or a challenge, and she was one of the sharpest shots in the city-state. Her services were soon requested by Demacia to help track down a mysterious outlaw who had begun committing high-profile heists. The bandit, who always left a card with an ornate 'C' at the scene of the crime, became Caitlyn's arch-nemesis. To this day, Caitlyn still searches for this cat burglar, and the chase has led her all across Valoran. She has joined the League to hone her skills and gain the influence necessary to track down the only quarry that has managed to evade her.\n\n''Go ahead, run. I'll give you a five minute head start.''\n- Caitlyn, from her book 'Willing Apprehension'.</Story>

      <Observation>
        Caitlyn enters the Great Hall with a series of whirs and clicks, as the lenses extending down from her hat adjust to allow her to study the space in meticulous detail. She has a long rifle slung over her shoulder, and she bears its weight so comfortably one would doubt she’s ever without it. Her ensemble is as alive with the activity of gears as it is revealing, both facets competing for attention.
        \n\n
        She takes the room in with the eye of an investigator, noting the placement of all objects. She scrutinizes the marble doors to the Reflecting Chamber with grim determination. Satisfied that she could analyze a crime scene there later if necessary, she pushes through the doors.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The darkness weighed on her skin like dew after a long stakeout, cool and sobering. As if in response to the thought, she heard the light patter of rain on cobblestone behind her. Startled, she spun around too quickly, banging her elbow against something solid. The “something” was a grimy brick wall on which a sinewy creature reminiscent of the Baron Nashor was graffitied in glorious detail. With conditioned skepticism, her eyes panned from the wall down the long alleyway next to her. She caught a gasp before it left her throat. Resilience Way. No matter how many hours she’d spent there, the place always gave her chills. Her gaze went to the sky, where she could see the spire of Constance Tower casting its familiar light out over the city, reminding Demacians never to slacken the grip on their ethical reins. Sadly ironic that the same tower allowed the fugitive, the mysterious “C”, to escape when he was so nearly within her grasp.
        \n\n
        She could recall every detail of the day on a whim. It sat in her memory like a picture of a dead lover taped to a mirror, there to remind you of what you could have had. The pursuit began in the lobby of the Artificer’s Guild Hall in Demacia’s crowded Honor Square. A student studying Advanced Techmaturgical Wafer Fabrication had, by chance, stopped at the Guild in order to speak with Moraj Wossit about her requirements for Guild entry. Wossit was some Average Joe paper-pusher who, unbeknownst to her and his superiors, had been ditching work early on Thursdays while he got, as he put it, “elective stress therapy”. Caitlyn had heard that line enough to know that he meant “something my wife and kids shouldn’t know about”. So much for Demacia’s bastion of morality, although in retrospect he could have just been watching a late League match with a brew for how tightly wound the city-state had its people. In any case, the student happened to barge into his office and found his desk in disarray with the window open. She retrieved a supervisor who, concerned, contacted the local authorities.
        \n\n
        Caitlyn had been in town investigating the last enigmatic card that “C” had left. It was the fourth in a series of roughly identical cards he’d left at the scenes of his heists. All of them bore only a single character: “C”. This one was left in place of the Celestial Crystal stolen from Freljord’s Dervish Crystal Hall. She’d determined that he chose paper stock in slightly different shades to let her know which part of Valoran he planned to hit next. There was some meaning to the ink and font he used, but she hadn’t cracked that yet at the time. Thanks to his earlier theft of the Greatsword of Milthorn from Demacia’s Royal Palace, Caitlyn had deduced that he meant to show up there again, and she was speaking with the constable when the message came from Guild Hall. She accompanied the constable there on a hunch, and when they arrived, the lobby was rife with security goons.
        \n\n
        The supervisor had been mindful enough to check the Senior Artificer’s office, where Wossit had been provisioned with special access. When he got there, the office was in a similar state of chaos. Most importantly, the treasured Helm of the Protector, which had been carried to Demacia years before by League Champion Poppy, was missing from an open safe. It had been entrusted to the Artificer’s Guild for some kind of magical tune-up, and the Guild monkeys had assured Caitlyn that the whole operation had been completely hush-hush. In the safe another card waited, mocking her inability to decipher its clues.
        \n\n
        Security locked the building down immediately. Caitlyn was listening to the Chief of Security’s recounting when she noticed one security officer who kept depriving her of a square look at his face. It was incidental enough to seem unimportant, but after five minutes of distracted glances, she decided to strike up a conversation. She made it a solid four steps in his direction before he bolted for the stairs.
        \n\n
        She chased him up ten flights of stairs, never breaking stride. She reached the roof just in time to see him swinging away on a line affixed to the top of the Constance Tower. As he swung, it was clear that he’d calculated this escape to reach the roof of the Gillson’s Training Hall. This was too close to let him slip away, so she leveled her rifle and took aim for a leg. Her quarry had slipped up this time, as he could not deviate from his path, and timing her shots was what Caitlyn did best.
        \n\n
        She pulled the trigger.
        \n\n
        In a flash, the perpetrator fell from the line. Caitlyn didn’t understand; the bullet shouldn’t have hit so soon. Time slowed to a crawl as she watched him descend through the air. She watched until he disappeared between the buildings and dashed back down the stairs.
        \n\n
        And here she was again. Standing in Resilience Alley where he fell. There were witnesses everywhere who saw him fall into the alley, and yet it was empty. No body, no blood, no explanation for how he could have survived, and nobody saw him leave. That night, she sat there in that raining dump of an alley for hours, searching for an answer.
        \n\n
        As though responding to the memory, a panel in the soaking cobblestone floor slid open.
        \n\n
        Caitlyn leapt back, jerking her rifle off her shoulder in a practiced motion and training it on the hole. A low chuckle echoed out from the darkness.
        \n\n
        “Tricky, aren’t I?” A voice said.
        \n\n
        Caitlyn couldn’t come to grips with the situation quickly enough. “Step out slowly!”
        \n\n
        “Nah, I’m not gonna do that.” The voice was tinged with amusement.
        \n\n
        “I’ll give you ‘til the count of three. If you aren’t in plain sight with your hands up, I’m just going to use the muzzle flash from this rifle to light my way.” Caitlyn was accustomed to overcoming obstacles. “One...”
        \n\n
        “You won’t do it, you don’t have the-“
        \n\n
        “Two...”
        \n\n
        “You know if you shoot me, you’ll never find out how I-“
        \n\n
        “Three.” Caitlyn pulled the trigger, but the gun clicked hollowly.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Caitlyn?” The voice was suddenly solemn.
        \n\n
        “I’ll ask the questions here! Who-“ She didn’t like being interrogated.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Caitlyn?” There was a level of control in the voice that caused a sense of dread to creep up her spine.
        \n\n
        “You already know the answer to that question or you wouldn’t have taken me here.” She waited, but no response came. “He’s the only case I’ve had to leave open. I’ll become better. I’m going to catch him, and the League will be my tool to do just that.”
        \n\n
        “How does it feel, exposing your mind?” The question came in a whisper from behind her ear, and the trap door in the alley snapped shut. She whirled about, but all she saw were the ornate marble doors of the Institute. Behind her lay the path to becoming a champion.
        \n\n
        “If you want a piece of my mind, just ask next time. I’ll save you the song and dance.” She smirked, knowing that she was being watched, before slinging her rifle over her shoulder and continuing into the League.

    <Story>While her sister Katarina has always been the most celebrated member of the household, the Du Couteau family has a long history of service to Noxus. It has often been said that no soldier has ever been as fortunate as General Du Couteau to have been graced with daughters. His youngest, Cassiopeia - despite lacking her sister's killer instincts - was equally renowned in court for her stately character and elegance. Cunning as she was beautiful, the temptress could never be found far from the arm of any foreign dignitary, her wiles prying secrets from the lips of even the most wary attach�. With the Noxian barbarian pacification campaign having ground to a standstill, Cassiopeia had set her sights on a diplomat from a tribe of the Freljord region. Thinking him an easy mark, the scheming seductress set about beguiling him. He refused to confide in her, however, until she swore an oath of secrecy upon his sword - a strange weapon with a serpentine curve to the blade. \n\nOnce her tryst was over, Cassiopeia provisioned her father with information regarding the barbarian resistance. As she divulged this intelligence, a wave of revulsion washed over her. She screamed in agony as her silky skin hardened to scales, her lustrous hair thickened to leather, and her manicured fingernails sharpened to claws. Dazed, she fell upon a group of horrified servants, rending them limb from limb in a heartbeat. When it was over the blood-soaked figure was no longer the ravishing jewel of the Noxian court, but a horror trapped somewhere between woman and serpent. Unable to serve in her traditional capacity, Cassiopeia departed for the League, continuing her service to Noxus on the Fields of Justice. \n\n''Though she may have appeared the innocent flower, she was the serpent under it.'' - Katarina, the Sinister Blade</Story>

      <Observation>
        Cassiopeia glides along the marvelous hallway with unnerving grace, the scrape of scale on marble announcing her passing to the empty corridor. Her elegant curves and stately posture combine to form an appalling juxtaposition to her serpentine body. The exquisite features of her face, wreathed in a cobra's hood, bears a look of chilling determination, while a serpent's tail conveys her expediently onward towards her destination.
        \n\n
        She pauses for a moment before a pair of grand double doors, the relief of a panther marking each one. Above the doors, carved on the stone archway, is an inscription: "The truest opponent lies within." Her eyes narrow as she reads the engraving.
        \n\n
        Cassiopeia stretches a taloned finger towards the door. It parts effortlessly at her touch, swinging open into blackness. She peers hesitantly into the black for a moment before composing herself and gliding inside.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        She found herself in her chambers in the Noxian estate she called home. An elegant curtain ran across the center of the room; a shroud against prying eyes. There, through the lace, stood the unmistakable figure of her father, General Marcus Du Couteau. She stared at him longingly, admiring everything about him, from his stately military garb to his perfect soldier's posture.
        \n\n
        He stepped forward, extending a hand towards the partition. There was moment of panic. No matter how many times she allowed her closest family to see her, she was always overwhelmed with anxiety and revulsion.
        \n\n
        "Don't look at me!" Cassiopeia lamented.
        \n\n
        The General froze for a moment. Then his voice took on a sterner character. "You are my daughter, Cassiopeia. And you are beautiful."
        \n\n
        "Liar!" she hissed, turning away. She could hear the rustling of curtains as he approached.
        \n\n
        "Daughter, look at me", he implored. Reluctantly, she complied, wiping away her tears with a viciously clawed hand. She did not speak.
        \n\n
        "Cassiopeia", he went on, taking a step forward, "I have been summoned. It is a grave matter, but one that I cannot refuse."
        \n\n
        "Take sister with you. She can keep you safe", she sobbed.
        \n\n
        Marcus shook his head, "Katarina cannot return. The matter with Ionia has not yet been settled, and her duty to the League compels her to stay."
        \n\n
        "Father, if you do not return, I will be alone", she stated.
        \n\n
        The General reached out to touch his daughter's face and she recoiled, turning her back again. His voice turned colder than iron. "You are a Du Couteau, Cassiopeia. You have served Noxus, and she cares for her children. You will never be alone." He paused. "One day, you will remember your duty."
        \n\n
        General Du Couteau took her hand and pressed a sealed letter into her palm, crumpling it slightly. "Should I not return, Cassiopeia, this will guide you and Katarina."
        \n\n
        Hearing her father turn to leave, Cassiopeia panicked. She spun about, but found herself alone. She examined the letter in her hand. It was marked in a wax signet that she did not recognize, but the seal was already broken. She unfolded the page.
        \n\n
        In blood red ink, someone had penned: "Transcendence Way, the Ivory Ward, 5:00 PM." Below it was a stamped image of a black rose.
        \n\n
        The peals of a clock tower caught her attention, followed by the sounds of bedlam. All around her the household abruptly became chaos. Each passing footfall and gossiping whisper filled her with ire. There came a hesitant knock at the door. She already knew who to expect.
        \n\n
        "Enter!" she commanded, her rage overcoming her revulsion at the thought of being seen. The door swung open, revealing one of her father's bodyguards. He entered slowly, staring intently at her silhouette on the other side of the curtains, his face a mixture of fear and shame.
        \n\n
        "Mistress Cassiopeia," he began, "Your father has..."
        \n\n
        She cut him off, "Spare me your excuses, fool! How did it happen!"
        \n\n
        "We were in the market," he stammered, "Your father slipped away."
        \n\n
        "And I ordered you to shadow him, did I not?" sneered Cassiopeia. She drew closer to the partition. The soldier looked away in shame. He did not answer. Cassiopeia sunk her talons into the hanging fabric, ripping it from its moorings in one swift motion and laying bare her monstrous body. "Speak, coward!" she commanded.
        \n\n
        The bodyguard backed away in horror, blanching white in shock.
        \n\n
        "What's wrong?" Cassiopeia teased, drawing one of her wicked hands to her face in feigned surprise. "Don’t you find me beautiful?"
        \n\n
        She advanced, fastening her claws securely around his neck. She lifted his worthless body and suddenly, a shattered pocket watch fell out of his pocket. The watch's hands stopped dead at a quarter past five. "This was all we found," he croaked.
        \n\n
        She caught her quarry's gaze in hers, his body shaking as she choked the life from him. His face was white as snow, but for some reason there was no fear in his eyes. Realization washed down the length of her serpentine body. Cassiopeia sneered. "Charlatan," she muttered, venom dripping from the words. "You force me to relive the moment I lost my father for your own sick pleasure?"
        \n\n
        The bodyguard's face turned as implacable as his eyes. "Why do you want to join the League, Cassiopeia?" he inquired.
        \n\n
        "My father is dead," she spat, "One of you knows something. And I will have justice."
        \n\n
        The soldier nodded. "How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        Cassiopeia's looked him dead in the eye. "Curse you," she muttered emotionlessly. The figure dissolved in her grip, leaving only the darkness. The doors to the League swung open.

    <Story>There is a place between dimensions, between worlds.  To some it is known as the Outside, to others it is the Unknown.  To those that truly know, however, it is called the Void.  Despite its name, the Void is not an empty place, but rather the home of unspeakable things - horrors not meant for minds of men.  Cho'Gath is a creature born of the Void, a thing whose true nature is so awful most will not speak its name.  Its fellows have been poking at the walls that divide dimensions for a crack, a way into Runeterra, where they can visit their own personal paradise of horror upon the world.  They are called the Voidborn, creatures so ancient and terrible that they have been removed from history altogether.  It is rumored that the Voidborn command vast armies of unspeakable creatures on other worlds, that they were once driven from Runeterra by powerful magic lost to antiquity.\n\nIf such tales are true, then the rumors that follow must be equally true - that one day, the Voidborn will return.  Even now, something dark stirs in Icathia, perverting the summoning rituals of the League to allow the presence of Cho'Gath.  It is an alien creature of malice and violence, a thing that causes all but the most stalwart to cringe in fear.  Cho'Gath even appears to feed on its predations, growing and swelling as it gorges itself.  Worse yet, the creature is intelligent, perhaps greatly so, making most wonder how such a monster could be contained.  Fortunately, the power of the League's summoning has confined Cho'Gath's presence exclusively to the League of Legends.  It is here that summoners use Cho'Gath's Voidborn abilities to help decide the fate of Runeterra.  The Terror of the Void knows what fate it would choose for Runeterra, given half the chance.\n\nWoe betide the day when Cho'Gath grows weary of the League.</Story>

    <Story>When Heimerdinger and his yordle colleagues migrated to Piltover, they embraced science as a way of life, and they immediately made several groundbreaking contributions to the techmaturgical community.  What yordles lack in stature, they make up for with industriousness.  Corki, the Daring Bombardier, gained his title by test-piloting one of these contributions - the original design for the Reconnaissance Operations Front-Line Copter, an aerial assault vehicle which has become the backbone of the Bandle City Expeditionary Force (BCEF).  Together with his squadron - the Screaming Yipsnakes - Corki soars over Valoran, surveying the landscape and conducting aerial acrobatics for the benefit of onlookers below.\n\nCorki is the most renowned of the Screaming Yipsnakes for remaining cool under fire and exhibiting bravery to the point of madness.  Before the League, he served several tours of duty, often volunteering for missions that would take him behind enemy lines, either gathering intelligence or delivering messages through hot zones.  He thrived on danger, and enjoyed nothing more than a good dogfight in the morning.  More than just an ace pilot, Corki also made several modifications to his copter, outfitting it with an arsenal of weapons which some speculate were more for show than functionality.  When open hostilities ceased as part of the agreement surrounding the formation of the League, Corki was forced into a retirement, which he felt ''cut the engines and clipped the wings''.  He tried to make do with stunt flying and canyon running, but it was never the same without the refreshing smell of gunpowder streaking through the air around him.  When Heimerdinger joined the League of Legends, it was no surprise to see Corki follow soon after, eager to test his mettle against the best the world has to offer.\n\nHe is Corki - death from above!</Story>

    <Story>
      There is no greater symbol of Noxian might than Darius, the nation's most feared and battle-hardened warrior. Orphaned at a young age, Darius had to fight to keep himself and his younger brother alive. By the time he joined the military, he had already developed the strength and discipline of a veteran soldier. The first true test of Darius's resolve occurred in a crucial battle against Demacia, where the Noxian forces were exhausted and outnumbered. Darius's captain called for his troops to retreat, but Darius refused to accept such an act of cowardice. Breaking formation, Darius strode towards the captain and decapitated him with one sweep of his gigantic axe. Both terrified and inspired, the soldiers followed Darius into battle and fought with incredible strength and fervor. After a long and grueling battle, they ultimately emerged victorious.
      \n\n
      Seizing momentum from this victory, Darius led his now fiercely loyal troops in a devastating campaign against Demacia. After proving his power on the battlefield, Darius turned his gaze homeward. He saw a Noxus riddled with weakness, where greedy, complacent nobles drained the nation's strength. Seeking to restore his country to greatness, Darius took it upon himself to reshape the Noxian leadership. He identified weak figureheads and violently removed them from their positions of power. Many in Noxus saw Darius's cull as an attempt to seize power, but he had a different plan for the throne. He had been watching the rise of Jericho Swain with keen interest. In Swain, Darius saw a leader with the mind and determination to bring Noxus to glory. Now allied with the Master Tactician, Darius works to unite the nation behind his vision of true Noxian strength.

    <Story>
      An unyielding avatar of the moon's power, Diana wages a dark crusade against the sun-worshiping Solari. Though she once sought the acceptance of her people, years of futile struggle shaped her into a bitter, resentful warrior. She now presents her foes with a terrible ultimatum: revere the moon's light, or die by her crescent blade.
      \n\n
      Though she was born to the Solari, Diana's inquisitive nature set her apart from her brethren. She had always found solace and guidance in the night sky, and questioned the dominance of the sun in her society. The Solari elders responded to her challenges with only derision and punishment. Diana remained convinced, however, that if she could find evidence of the moon's power, the elders would listen to reason. For years, she studied Solari archives in solitude until she discovered an encoded message hidden in an old tome. This clue led her to a secluded valley on Mount Targon where she unearthed the hidden entrance to an ancient, sealed temple. Inside, among aging relics and faded murals, she found an ornate suit of armor and a beautiful crescent blade, both inscribed with sigils of the moon. Diana donned the armaments and returned to the Solari elders that night. She declared that the artifacts proved others had once worshiped the moon as she did. Her discovery of evidence challenging Solari dominion shocked the elders. To Diana's horror, they pronounced her a heretic and condemned her to death. As the elders prepared her for execution, Diana's anger and sorrow overwhelmed her desire for acceptance. She lifted her gaze to the sky, calling upon the moon for strength. Lunar power surged within her and she shattered her bindings. Raising her relic blade, she turned and slaughtered the elders. With the temple in ruins behind her, Diana resolved to destroy all those who would deny the power of the moon.

    <Story>It is said that the man now known as Dr. Mundo was born without any sort of conscience.  Instead, he had an unquenchable desire to inflict pain through experimentation. By the time he was five, most of the pets in the Zaun neighborhood where Mundo grew up had gone missing. By his teenage years, his parents were nowhere to be found. By the time he had legally acquired his license to practice medicine, he had been acquitted of thirty-eight separate charges of murder by the Zaun authorities; the lack of evidence made prosecution impossible.\n\nDr. Mundo has become equal parts serial killer and mad scientist, though no one is entirely sure how his butchery qualifies as science. However, he has made tremendous strides in mapping the pain response in the human brain and body, going so far as being able to suppress it, even in the most excruciating of circumstances. He has also tapped into the primal parts of the brain through chemistry, learning how to enhance aggression and adrenaline, as well as dulling conscience and the survival instinct. In short, Dr. Mundo's life's work has been how to create the perfect science-enhanced killer.  Unfortunately, the city-state of Noxus regards such behavior as a sign of initiative and ambition, rather than inhumanity. Originally fighting for Zaun, Dr. Mundo was recruited to also fight for Noxus in the League of Legends; the Madman dual faction status represents the fruits of a blossoming relationship between Zaun and Noxus. He continues his experiments to this day, even using himself as an experimental subject, as evidenced by his disfigured appearance and his... unique manner of speaking. There are rumors that the High Command in Noxus has given him free reign to pursue his life's work in his spare time.\n\nBeware the Madman of Zaun. In his eyes, you are already dead.</Story>

    <Story>
      Unlike his brother  Darius, victory in battle was never enough for Draven. He craved recognition, acclaim, and glory. He first sought greatness in the Noxian military, but his flair for the dramatic went severely underappreciated. Thirsting for a method to share "Draven" with the world, he turned his attention to the prison system. There he carved out the celebrity he desired by turning the tedious affair of executions into a premiere spectacle.
      \n\n
      At Draven's first execution, he shocked onlookers when he ordered the doomed prisoner to run for dear life. Just before the man managed to flee from sight, Draven brought him down with a flawless throw of his axe. Soon, all Draven's executions became a gauntlet through which Noxian prisoners raced for a final chance at life. He used this trial as his own personal stage, and turned executions into a leading form of entertainment. He rallied onlookers into a frenzy, while desperate prisoners scrambled to evade him. They never succeeded. Rejecting the solemn, black uniforms of Noxian executioners, Draven donned bright outfits and developed flashy signature moves to distinguish himself. Crowds flocked to see Draven in action, and tales of his performances spread quickly. As his popularity grew, so did his already-inflated ego. He belonged at the center of attention. Before long, the scope of his ambitions outgrew the population of Noxus. He decided that the glorious exploits of Draven should be put on display for the entire world.

    <Story>Evelynn's origins are shrouded in mystery - a mystery she herself helps to perpetuate.  What everyone does know about Evelynn, however, is that she is one of the most skilled assassins in Valoran.  It is clear upon first meeting her that she is not quite human.  Some theorize that she was cursed with a mild form of fantastical vampirism as a child.  Supporters of this theory contend that her ability to sap the very life essence of her opponents on (and off) the Fields of Justice, while still being able to tolerate direct sunlight, would account for this belief.  There is some evidence that Evelynn originally came from the Shadow Isles - the mysterious island located northwest of Valoran that is eternally blanketed by a thick, unnatural fog.  It is thought that the Shadow Isles are home to countless forms of undead, though no one seems eager to perform the exploration necessary to find out the truth.  Evelynn neither confirms nor denies her connection to Shadow Isles.\n\nThe power brokers of Valoran know that Evelynn's services come at the highest of premiums, and her recent addition to the League of Legends indicates that her ambitions are growing.  Her savagery on the Fields of Justice has been so great that new rumors about her origins are now circulating.  The most popular one - an abuse of magic as a child morphed her into the hungering beast her opponents see on the battlefield - always makes her smile when hearing it... an act that bares her razor-sharp fangs and teeth.  Evelynn now curries favor from League summoners, gaining influence for reasons known only to her.  While the nature of her plans- much like almost everything else about her - remains unknown, there's little doubt that those plans are now set on the world stage. \n\n''There is little mystery about her to me - she is the ultimate predator.'' - Jax</Story>

  <Champion name="Ezreal" title="The Prodigal Explorer" range="550" gender="m" rp="975" ip="6300" spotlight="0dGYt0Ibw94" abilityVideoID="0081">
    <Story>Ezreal was born with the gift of magic flowing through his veins. Ezreal, however, was also born with a much stronger sense of wanderlust. Put into school to become a skilled techmaturgist, Ezreal quickly became bored with magical studies. By the time the boy genius was eight years old, he had fully mapped out the underground tunnels of Piltover. The quality of his work was so great that the government of Piltover purchased his maps and salaried his services as Piltover's Grandmaster Explorer. This sealed the deal on Ezreal's path in life - he would eschew the arcane arts in favor of archaeology. Since then, countless of Ezreal's adventures have been written about as romanticized stories.\n\nOne of Ezreal's latest adventures, however, has brought him face-to-face with his other legacy - his latent magical power. While exploring the pyramids of Shurima Desert, Ezreal uncovered an amulet of incredible power. Aside from the sheer size of the amulet (it was made for a being easily twice Ezreal's size), it allows the wielder to control and shape magical energy - provided a source of magic is in the vicinity. This allowed Ezreal to tap into his natural talent for magic without having to put any serious effort into it - a big win for the Prodigal Explorer. The drawback is that for some unknown reason, the amulet is attuned with summoning magic. Without warning, Ezreal may find himself acting as a champion for, as he puts it, ''a summoner hell-bent on resolving some irrelevant world-shattering League conflict.'' Still, Ezreal feels being summoned into a Field of Justice on occasion is a small price to pay.\n\n''There's little time to study musty tomes when you're busy crawling around where the musty tomes originally came from.'' Such is Ezreal's credo.</Story>

  <Champion name="Fiddlesticks" title="The Harbinger of Doom" range="480" gender="m" rp="585" ip="1350" spotlight="uc_-ms5ADhk" abilityVideoID="0009">
    <Story>
      For nearly twenty years, Fiddlesticks has stood alone in the easternmost summoning chamber of the Institute of War. Only the burning emerald light of his unearthly gaze pierces the musty darkness of his dust-covered home. It is here that the Harbinger of Doom keeps a silent vigil. His is a cautionary tale of power run amok, taught to all summoners within the League. Decades ago, there existed a powerful rune mage from Zaun - Istvaan. At the end of the fifth Rune War, he became one of the League's first summoners.  Too much a prisoner to the old ways of magic, Istvaan stepped further and further outside the rules of conduct in the League. In what was ultimately his last match, his reach finally exceeded his grasp. Sealing himself inside the easternmost summoning chamber, he began incanting the most forbidden of rituals - an extra-planar summoning.
      \n\n
      What exactly happened inside that chamber remains unknown. No champion came to represent Zaun that day in Summoner's Rift. Only silence echoed back from repeated knocks on the chamber door. The first apprentice who entered was cut down immediately by an unearthly scythe. What few who followed and survived were driven mad by fear, mere husks of men gibbering about crows and death. Afraid of the evil even Istvaan could not control, the League sealed all exits to the chamber, hoping they could contain what they could not destroy.  Years went by, but the wooden figure within never moved save to slay any foolish enough to enter. Seeing no recourse to reclaim the chamber, the Council instead devised a use for Fiddlesticks: executioner. While he comes to life and seemingly abides by the rules of summoning in the Fields of Justice, what he awaits inside his chamber is unknown. His unmoving face yields no clues, and his scythe stands ready to strike down any who stand before him.

    <Story>
      As the youngest child of the noble House Laurent, Fiora always considered herself destined for greatness. The Laurents had dominated the dueling culture of Demacia's aristocracy for centuries, and Fiora's father was regarded as one of the finest swordsmen the nation had ever seen. Inspired by his tales of glory, Fiora began training as soon as she could wield a blade and quickly showed greater talent than any of her siblings. As she grew older, her self-confidence and rigid discipline only widened the gulf of expertise between Fiora and her peers. Her fellow duelists perceived her confidence as arrogance, but none could defeat her in combat, and each victory only heightened her lofty self-esteem. Even so, Fiora never allowed herself to become complacent in her training, and she drove herself ever harder to become a worthy successor to her father's legacy.
      \n\n
      Her devotion turned out to be misplaced. On the eve of an arranged duel, Fiora's father was caught slipping a slow paralysis poison into his opponent's drink. Following the incident, many of his past opponents came forward with their own accusations: envenomed weapons, bribery, blackmail, and more. In an instant, he had destroyed his family's honorable reputation. Fiora was outraged. Not only had her hero betrayed her ideals, but Demacia's dueling elite now doubted her own ability. She desperately wanted to wipe the stain from her family's history but, even more, she wanted the world to acknowledge her mastery. She found her solution in the one arena where she could fight the world's strongest warriors without being accused of dishonesty: the League of Legends.

    <Story>
      Centuries ago, an ancient water-dwelling race built a hidden city beneath a mountain in the sea. Though these creatures had their enemies, the city was an impenetrable fortress, and, in the safety it provided, they grew complacent. Fizz, however, harbored a curious spirit that could not be satisfied living so cushioned a life. Unable to resist the allure of danger, Fizz had a habit of sneaking out of the city to look for trouble. In his many adventures he grew to be a powerful fighter with a sharp cleverness that let him skirt danger with ease. One day Fizz returned to find the city abandoned: his people had vanished, leaving Fizz without a clue to explain their disappearance. With nothing left in the city to keep him, Fizz salvaged an enchanted seastone trident from the ruins and set out alone.
      \n\n
      Fizz wandered the ocean in search of his people for years, using the skills he’d learned during his adventures as young boy to survive. Finally, Fizz discovered the port of Bilgewater. He was fascinated with the existence of life above the water and could not resist exploring the island. In his endless curiosity, Fizz inadvertently meddled in the affairs of the humans who lived there, and his presence did not go unnoticed. His mischief angered many residents who eventually sought to capture or kill him. Fizz found himself cornered, and he prepared to return to the sea despite the fondness he’d come to hold for Bilgewater. As he stood at the docks, a massive dragon-shark attacked the port. Fizz defeated the beast, using his resourcefulness and knowledge of the creature’s weaknesses to his advantage. Having earned the gratitude and respect of the humans, Fizz decided to stay in Bilgewater. To further serve his new home, he joined the League of Legends.

    <Story>Long before the League's regulation of such magic, mages experimented with the creation of artificial life.  Now forbidden, instilling golems with reason was once not so uncommon a practice amongst the more expert of craftsmen.  One such visionary was the Demacian artificer, Durand.  Peerless at crafting sentient beings, Durand's constructs served as tireless guardians for the border towns of his beloved city-state, affording them protection from their Noxian neighbors.  For his own defense, however, Durand kept his magnum opus: Galio.  This mighty construct - forged in the image of a gargoyle - kept him safe on his journeys, allowing him to perform his important work without fear of reprisal from those hostile to his homeland.  That is, until dealing with his taxing sentinels finally roused the ire of the Noxian High Command.\n\nAs Durand crossed the Howling Marsh with his masterwork in tow, he was set upon by Noxian assassins in force.  Outnumbered and overwhelmed, Galio looked on in horror as the murderers cut down his charge, executing him swiftly before vanishing back into the mists.  Stripped of his reason for being, Galio despaired.  For years he remained in solitude, standing vigil over the bones of the master he had failed to protect... a literal monument to his own everlasting shame.  Then, one nondescript day, a sad but determined yordle girl carrying a mighty Demacian crown stopped in the shadow of a great statue to rest.  Hidden in plain sight from his unsuspecting visitor, Galio studied the forlorn yordle.  She looked as though she too shouldered a tremendous burden.  As quietly and as stoically as she had arrived, she departed in the direction of Demacia.  This encounter lit a spark in Galio's eye.  Remembering the cause that his master had died defending, Galio arose from his silent purgatory and followed in the wake of this brave creature.  He had a new reason to live: to join the League of Legends and fight for the will of Demacia.\n\n''There is no such thing as redemption.  Only penance.''  - Galio</Story>

    <Judgment date="10 August, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Galio wears a face as though he is lost in concentration. One may mistake this look to mean the great beast is dumbfounded. His facial features, especially his massive jaw with the exaggerated underbite, give the massive gargoyle the look of a simpleton. This look is intentionally deceptive, magically crafted to lull an opponent into thinking that Galio is mentally slow. The reality of the situation is that he is intently studying what lies before him. The double doors – and the sign above it – are all that matters.
        \n\n
        “The truest opponent lies within.”
        \n\n
        Galio nods knowingly, but does not move afterwards. His form is literally statuesque.
        \n\n
        After a lengthy pause, Galio springs to life, lumbering toward the door. Broad, powerful wings spread wide and slowly beat against the stillness of the air, propelling the gargoyle forward with a not-so-gentle whoosh. He moves as gracefully as a being made of stone and metal can.
        \n\n
        The doors swing open, revealing the inky blackness within. The engraved obsidian panthers that flank the doorway point the way inward for Galio. He obliges his stony brethren.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        With a sudden flood of light, Galio knew where he was. There was never a chance of him forgetting this place. The clearing was surrounded by a thick copse of fruit trees. In the center of the clearing were Durand’s bones, blanched from countless days of weathering. He could smell the peaches and cherries ripening on the branches.
        \n\n
        Galio loathed that smell; the stench of sweet fruit growing, ripening, and rotting in a never-ending cycle reminded him of his failure to save Durand, his creator. He had failed to protect his master from the Noxian assassins who ambushed them, and it was here that he kept a penitent vigil for years afterwards.
        \n\n
        I wish they killed me instead. He thought it now as he did back then, but this time he knew something was different. An unwelcome thought masquerading as his own edged its way into his consciousness.
        \n\n
        No. I do not.
        \n\n
        Galio shifted in place, trying to shake the invasive notion out of his head. He knew it was impossible for him to actually be here, but everything felt real. The sickly-sweet scent of the fruit made him anxious. Was this still the Judgment?
        \n\n
        “It is, Galio of Demacia.” The squeaky, yet powerful yordle voice belonged to a female.
        \n\n
        Sitting on a nearby stump was a familiar face. He recognized the female yordle, but she was not wearing what Galio remembered her wearing when they first met on this very spot. She wore the armor of a Demacian warrior. He now knew the yordle as Poppy, though when he first met her he did not know her name. He never spoke to Poppy then; in fact, he never even let her know that he was aware of her presence. Poppy had seen Galio standing in the clearing, but she never gave any indication that she thought he was anything more than an inanimate statue.
        \n\n
        “You are Poppy.” Galio spoke with words that were carefully chosen. “I know you. This was before you joined the League. I saw you. Here.”
        \n\n
        The yordle girl smiled, though she shook her head slightly. “Here... yes, you met Poppy here, but alas – I am not Poppy.” The yordle girl stood and approached Galio, extending her hand. “You know this to be true.” The girl smiled again. “It’s okay if you want to keep calling me Poppy.”
        \n\n
        Galio had watched this place for years, but for the first time, he permitted himself an examination of the environment without analyzing for ambush points or areas of defensive weakness. A sudden slight breeze carried the scent of the trees away. He could hear leaves gently rustling. He noticed how the drifting blossoms twirled with each pulse of the wind.
        \n\n
        Galio extended his talon-like paw and took the yordle girl’s tiny hand into his own. He could feel the warmth of her flesh on his sculpted hide. “Thank you, Poppy.”
        \n\n
        She nodded. “Why do you want to join the League, Galio?”
        \n\n
        The pungent fruit smell wafted back into the clearing, making Galio slightly jittery. “I must fight for Demacia. It was my creator’s home.”
        \n\n
        Poppy clasped the gargoyle’s remaining free hand. As she stood facing Galio, she looked up at him with kind, yet serious eyes. “Why do you want to join the League, Galio?”
        \n\n
        Galio thought carefully about Poppy’s question; he knew this was not the real Poppy, but he could surmise that her image was being used for a reason. He remembered that it was the sight of the determined yordle that broke him from his exile. He knew that she herself bore a tremendous burden. It was the same sort of burden that he too struggled to cope with – the burden of failure. Galio had later learned that Poppy lost her father in an ambush also perpetrated by Noxian assassins.
        \n\n
        They had such a horrific event in common, but they addressed it so differently. Poppy became even more resolute to complete her mission – to deliver a crown crafted by her father to a Demacian general. Galio chose... a different path. He now realized that it was his choice and his choice alone to stand vigil not over the remains of his creator, but rather over his own hubris.
        \n\n
        He looked away from Poppy for a moment, ashamed. He now knew the answer. “I want to join because it is my choice. It is my own free will. I want to fight for my creator’s... for my home.”
        \n\n
        “How does it feel, exposing your mind?”
        \n\n
        The pungent odor had dissipated once more. Galio looked down upon Poppy, smiling a slightly fanged grin. “It is... familiar to me. I shared my mind with my creator. I am sharing my mind with you. I will share my mind with any summoner.”
        \n\n
        Another flood of light washed over Galio. He stood alone in front of a new set of double doors. There was no pause this time – Galio swung the doors wide and entered the League of Legends.

    <Story>Gangplank was born the son of the dread pirate captain Vincent the Shadow - one of the most wealthy and feared pirates in all of Blue Flame Island.  One might think this would have spoiled the boy with a cushioned life of privilege, but the truth is quite the opposite.  Growing up in the city of Bilgewater isn't easy; pirates are not known for their compassion, and that most certainly extends to their families.  Vincent wanted his son to grow up tough and strong, so he was extremely hard on the young Gangplank.  Even as a child, Gangplank was as mean as a snake and is said to have slept with his eyes open.  As he grew, the young man rapidly became the most ruthless and feared pirate in all of Bilgewater, and his daddy was never more proud than on the day of his son's eighteenth birthday - when Gangplank stabbed his old man in the back and claimed the famed pirate ship, the Dead Pool, for his own.\n\nThe continent of Valoran, however, is a dangerous place for pirates; Gangplank could read the writing on the wall.  The den of pirates known as Bilgewater would soon be pulled down by the undertow of Valoranian politics and the Institute of War.  It was time for Bilgewater to have their own champion to represent them in the League of Legends, and who better than the fiercest pirate of them all?  It is said that Gangplank has enough power and favor to claim the title of the Pirate King back home, but that he is simply biding his time and building his reputation as a champion before he returns to a life of piracy.\n\nYo ho, blow the man down.  Or at least shoot him when his back is turned and steal all his booty.</Story>

    <Story>Throughout Valoran, the resolve of Demacia's military is alternately celebrated or despised, but always respected.  Their ''zero tolerance'' moral code is strictly upheld by civilians and soldiers alike.  In combat, this means Demacian troops may not make excuses, flee, or surrender under any circumstance.  These principles are espoused to their forces by unrivaled demagogues who lead by example.  Garen, the valiant warrior who bears the title ''the Might of Demacia'', is the paradigm to which these leaders are compared.  Thousands of great heroes have risen and fallen on the bloody battlefields between Demacia and its preeminent rival, Noxus.  It was beneath their mighty banners of war that Garen first met steel with Katarina, the Sinister Blade.  The infantrymen who beheld this event (and survived) commented that it seemed as though the two were locked in a mortal waltz against a symphony of clashing blades.\n\nGaren, the pride of the Demacian military and leader of the Dauntless Vanguard, returned from this battle breathless for the first time in his career, though some speculate that this was due to reasons other than exhaustion.  The plausibility of these rumors was bolstered when, in every instance thereafter, Garen seized the opportunity to encounter the Sinister Blade again.  A paragon of Demacian ethic, Garen never entertained such allegations, for he knew others couldn't understand.  Even simply the pursuit of a worthy opponent on the battlefield is, to a true warrior, the reason to rise each morning.  The promise of one, particularly so beautifully and diametrically opposed, is the validation of his existence. \n\n''The most effective way to kill an opponent is to slice through the man next to him.'' - Garen, on front line strategy</Story>

    <Story>The foothills of the Great Barrier are home to the hardiest people found anywhere on Valoran. Only those with great fortitude and endurance dwell in what is perhaps the most rugged and unforgiving environment anywhere on the face of Runeterra. It is here that the mighty Gragas keeps permanent residence, living south of Noxus. This behemoth of a man has long eschewed the rigors of civilization for what he calls his ''slice of paradise;'' he has no neighbors to bother him and plenty of space to pursue his life's ambition - brewing.  Grogs, ales, meads, and wine - nothing is beyond his skill to brew. What makes Gragas a truly special brewmaster, however, is his proximity to a large and powerful nexus.\n\nThe magic of this nexus has seeped into his fermented creations, and Gragas has consumed enough of his own poison over the years to slake the thirst of an army. This arcane alcohol has caused Gragas to swell both in height and girth; he looms over the tallest of men and boasts nearly twice their width. To complement his immoderate size, Gragas has developed an ornery temper - one fueled by liquor and raw magic. His infrequent sojourns into Noxus for supplies always unfold the same way: Gragas enters a Noxian tavern, Gragas gets into several fights, Gragas lays out countless citizens, and finally Gragas flees for the foothills with Noxian constables in hot - though reluctant - pursuit. His misadventures have garnered him the attention of several summoners in the League of Legends, and he is now a willing champion in the arenas...doling out hard liquor and harder fists.\n\nThe Rabble Rouser leaves a path of drunken destruction in his wake, both in the Fields of Justice and off.</Story>

    <Story>
      Malcolm Graves was born in the back of a Bilgewater tavern and left there with a bottle of spiked milk. He survived a childhood in the pirate-run slums using every dirty trick in the book. Intent on building a new life for himself, he stowed away on the first ship to the mainland he could sneak aboard. However, the grim realities of the world forced him to eke out an unsavory living in the underground of various city-states, jumping the border whenever things got too hot. At a particularly high-stakes game of cards, he found himself seated opposite Twisted Fate. They both flipped four aces on the final hand. It was the first time either conman had met his equal. The two formed an alliance, swindling marks at the tables and scrapping back-to-back in the alleys afterward. Together, they ran the streets – stacking chips, decks, and rap sheets.
      \n\n
      Unfortunately Graves made the mistake of hustling a hefty sum from Dr. Aregor Priggs, a high-ranking Zaunite official and businessman. When Priggs discovered how he’d been played, he became obsessed with revenge. He learned about Twisted Fate’s all-consuming desire to control magic and he promptly offered him a trade: serve Graves up in exchange for enrollment in a procedure which would grant his wish. Twisted Fate took the deal – both he and Graves knew the stakes of their arrangement, but the offer was too good. Once acquired, Priggs had Graves taken to a special location built to hold men whose crimes – or more precisely their punishments – were meant to stay off the books. Graves endured years of captivity at the hands of Zaun’s most unscrupulous wardens before he managed to escape. One of his fellow detainees introduced him to an eccentric gunsmith who modified a shotgun exactly to his specifications. He named it “Destiny.” After he paid a visit to Priggs, Graves joined the League of Legends with two targets in his sights: Twisted Fate and payback.

    <Judgment date="14 October, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Malcolm Graves is the picture of resilience. His body, a checkerboard of scars and cracked calluses, remains fit despite his age. His expression is grim, determined. He carries an oversized shotgun in one hand. Its weight is irrational for its function, but it complements him well.
        \n\n
        However, the real story lies in his eyes. They seem stubbornly fixed on something beyond his vision, something unachievable, some goal that has always remained slightly out of reach. Nothing will steer him from his course. It’s as though he has pursued the carrot-on-a-stick for so long that, even though he learned the trick, it’s all he knows how to do anymore.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Same old song and dance, Graves thought. Couple of big wigs trying to put on a show.
        \n\n
        Graves wasn’t one for theatrics. He preferred to keep most of his social interactions 12-gauge and below. Things hadn’t always been this way. Once upon a time, he genuinely delighted in the game, fleecing marks and skipping town before the chips could fall. Back then he had a partner with a like-minded philosophy: the longer the con, the better.
        \n\n
        Good times.
        \n\n
        Then Twisted Fate turned on him faster than a foal in a firepit.
        \n\n
        Graves was no stranger to the double cross, but somehow Fate managed to blindside him. Never again. He paid a fair chunk of his life for that oversight. It was a hard lesson, but then again the most important ones tended to be.
        \n\n
        Now all that was left was to even the score.
        \n\n
        The clank of crashing steel broke his thoughts. It was a tone of bitter finality, the chime of swindled life. He knew it well. He spun to find a familiar set of bars lined mockingly between him and the freedom he so recently won. Behind them, the oily face of the man who incarcerated him, Dr. Aregor Priggs, sneered in victory. He raised his arm, happy to put a slug between Priggs’ beady eyes, but his hand was empty.
        \n\n
        He was trapped, again, in Priggs’ privately funded detention facility.
        \n\n
        Well, this is a setback.
        \n\n
        Priggs grinned broadly, gathering a froth of reeking spittle in the corners of his mouth. He was a bulbous, slimy man whose only redeeming quality, as far as Graves was concerned, was that he had the stones to look his captives in the eye while he kept them holed up like dogs. Graves had worked out that Priggs used this little sanctuary primarily as a place to make high-profile competitors disappear, but he had earned a special cell for taking two of Priggs’ more fetching mistresses for a week-long excursion on the sleaze’s dime. By the time Priggs’ retinue of head-bobbing corporate flunkies tracked all the funds Graves funneled, he and Fate were already in Demacia hustling vacationers on Conqueror Beach.
        \n\n
        “I bet you thought you saw the last of me,” Priggs wheezed. He always wheezed when he talked.
        \n\n
        “The last I cared to,” Graves said. “You looked a might improved with that pig face of yours spread across a wall.” Every word carried a consequence, so Graves chose to savor them.
        \n\n
        “Aren’t you curious how I did it?” Priggs was pleased with himself.
        \n\n
        “I don’t wonder why critters come crawling back, I just stomp harder next time.”
        \n\n
        “I hope you still have that spirit when I’m through with you,” Priggs spat. Graves didn’t flinch. He may as well have been a tick for how long he’d held on in that place, with few friends and fewer decencies, tended by whatever trash Priggs found to run the outfit. Pain had long ago become a chore more than any kind of punishment.
        \n\n
        “I hope you eat something lighter the next time I make you soil yourself,” he returned.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Graves?” The question was unusually direct for the wheezing oaf, but when the subject was the most powerful organization in Valoran, perhaps even his chaps got a little chafed.
        \n\n
        “Don’t know why you’d stop to wonder,” he said. “You know my history as well as anyone.”
        \n\n
        “Miss me that much?” The new voice, a relic from the past, made Graves’ blood boil. He grabbed the bars, knuckles white, as Twisted Fate strolled into view behind Priggs.
        \n\n
        “Fate! I know you’re crooked as a quarryman’s spine, but you got a real set of tires throwing in with this sack of stool again!” This wasn’t the reunion Graves had planned all these years.
        \n\n
        “Why you-” the fat man sputtered.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Graves?” Twisted Fate’s face was calm, unreadable.
        \n\n
        “You let me out of this cage and I’ll show you-” Graves roared.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want-” Fate started again.
        \n\n
        “I’m going to ruin your con, Fate! The world may buy that you’re some kind of ‘champion,’ but I’m gonna show them what you really are. I will take everything you have, and when I’m done, you’ll be lucky to scam the heat off a campfire.” Graves took a deep breath. He didn’t realize how much Twisted Fate had gotten to him. He silently vowed never to give Fate the satisfaction of seeing him this angry again.
        \n\n
        “How does it feel, exposing your mind?” Fate smirked, a simple gesture that was acid in Graves’ veins. He swallowed, determined not to lose his cool again.
        \n\n
        “Feels like I just squatted with spurs on,” he muttered.
        \n\n
        Fate chuckled. “It’s good to see you again, Malcolm.”
        \n\n
        With that, he strode out of sight, Priggs close on his heels. Graves sat in his cell, smoldering, until the bars suddenly opened. Cautiously, he exited the cell…
        \n\n
        ...and found himself standing in the Institute of War, weapon in hand.
        \n\n
        Always putting on a show.
        \n\n
        Graves clenched his teeth and cocked his gun. He wasn’t one for theatrics, but if it was a show they wanted...

    <Story>
      Since his first sighting on the northwestern shores of Valoran, the towering, armored specter known as Hecarim struck a chilling fear into the hearts of all who laid eyes upon him. No one had ever seen anything like his titanic, ethereal form before, and the mystery of his sudden arrival was deeply unnerving. When Hecarim began to march eastwards, leaving a trail of desolate, lifeless ground behind him, the villagers of the plains fled their homes for the safety of nearby Demacia. In the city's now-overcrowded taverns, rumors about this inhuman phantom spread in hushed whispers. Some claimed that he was the vengeful shade of an ancient warrior, intent on destroying all living beings; one man insisted that they had seen him leading an entire legion of spectral cavalrymen; others still believed him to be the creation of some hateful necromancer. One Demacian commander, seeking to dispel the terror that had gripped the city, assembled a few of his finest soldiers and rode out to turn back or destroy Hecarim.
      \n\n
      The commander led his soldiers to stand in Hecarim's path and braced for his assault. As the apparition bore down on them, an overwhelming sensation of dread gripped the warriors. The men, frozen in fear, could only scream as the ghostly titan ran them down, tearing them apart and trampling them beneath his iron hooves. Hecarim turned to the crippled, cowering commander and uttered a chilling statement: ''This is merely the beginning. No mortal army can withstand the might of the Shadow Isles.'' With that, Hecarim departed, resuming his grim march. Driven to insanity by his nightmarish experience, the commander stumbled back to Demacia, where his dire warnings were dismissed as the ravings of a madman. While Hecarim's origin and intent were still a mystery, his destination became clear when he reached the Institute of War and, in a voice both ominous and commanding, demanded entry into the League of Legends.

    <Story>It is unusual to see yordles outside of Bandle City, but the lure of science was something Heimerdinger could not resist.  By the time he'd completed his third doctorate, he had already become the greatest of all yordle scientists and there was little his home could still offer him.  The great academies of Piltover far to the north called to him, daring him to make his mark in the City of Progress.  Knowing he would never thrive away from his own kind, Heimerdinger gathered like-minded yordles to join him in his quest, thus forming the backbone of the now famous Yordle Academy of Science &amp; Progress.  Since then, he has become one of the most respected minds of the modern age and his academy is one of the leading institutions in all of Valoran.\n\nHeimerdinger has pioneered many new scientific achievements, delving deeper and deeper into the field of techmaturgy, including the development of the now ubiquitous star-rods that light many of the streets of the city-states.  However, there is something strange about the Revered Inventor.  In his quest to expand knowledge, he underwent an experiment of his own design to allow him to use a greater portion of his brain simultaneously.  It most certainly worked, but at an unusual cost - Heimerdinger's brain increased in size.  His head changed along with it and now the great scientist looks like a yordle with a giant brain-shaped head.  Heimerdinger has turned his attentions to the current state of war on Valoran, however, and works to rectify what he considers is an unacceptable situation.  Heimerdinger believes that science is the key to saving the world.  Much more, he has rolled up his sleeves and is out to prove this as a member of the League of Legends - most definitely as the League's smartest champion!\n\nScience is on the march.

    <Story>The Ionians have developed some of the most breathtaking and deadly martial arts on all of Runeterra - just one manifestation of their pursuit of enlightenment. The most remarkable blade style to emerge, however, was the unusual byproduct of foreign intervention. Master Lito was a swordsman whose teachings were sought by ruling classes from nearly every city-state. His art was a highly-guarded secret, but it was said that swords would breathe in his grasp. He withered unexpectedly from a mysterious disease which baffled the brightest of Runeterran physicians. When he died, he left behind Zelos and Irelia, his son and daughter, and a truly unique weapon. Zelos became a sergeant in the Ionian military and left to seek assistance from Demacia immediately prior to Noxus' invasion of Ionia. Irelia, charged with the protection of their home until Zelos returned, was alone when the Noxian forces struck.\n\nThe Ionians fought admirably, but soon Ionian blood stained the land beneath the prints of foreign boots. At the Great Stand of the Placidium, Ionians prepared for surrender, but were inspired to maintain their resistance when the young Irelia lifted her father's enormous blade and pledged to hold until her brother returned. In the chaos of the ensuing fight, Irelia was cursed with dark Noxian Necromancy. As her life ebbed, Soraka, the Starchild, made a final attempt to anchor her fading soul. Unwilling to relinquish her home, Irelia rose at the brink of death, and her father's sword lifted in the air alongside her. Irelia rushed back to the fore, unfazed by the blade's sudden animation. The weapon danced around her effortlessly, cutting down Noxians as they gaped in horror. The decimated invaders were forced to retreat from the Placidium. Irelia was appointed Ionia's Captain of the Guard, and when the defense of her homeland moved to the Fields of Justice, so did she.\n\n'The sword flourishes, as though painting with blood.'\n- Taken from a Noxian Field Report</Story>

    <Judgment date="12 November, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        An enormous four-pronged blade parts the air for Irelia as she enters the Great Hall. The unusual weapon, once owned by her father, hovers unaided two meters above the ground. Irelia follows it apathetically, her mind focused on the task at hand. Aside from her pristine armor, which is polished dutifully for presentation, Irelia puts no effort into her appearance. Her face is seen only in glimpses behind her swaying hair. She's young, though the youthful spark in her eyes is tarnished with the blood of the battlefield.

        She maintains a bold presence, fitting for the captain of the Ionian guard. Despite bearing the responsibility of Ionia's safety, her shoulders are as square and resolute as her Mantle of Decorum - Ionia's highest decoration. The capricious sword darts ahead of her to the marble doors, halting beneath the inscription. There it shivers imperceptibly, emitting a high-pitched whine. Whether because of apprehension or excitement, it is unclear. Irelia, expressionless, passes it and walks into the blackness.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The darkness set Irelia on edge; this was an unsafe manner in which to conduct an interview. She felt the blade circling around her, probing for threats she couldn't see. She hoped the agents of the League had the wisdom to approach her with care, as a surprise assault would end unfortunately... for them.
        \n\n
        Irelia had a knack for steel; it spoke to her. Closing her eyes, she extended her senses - a meditative exercise her father taught her to perceive unseen threats. Air is the same as water, you simply must heed the ripples. His words echoed in her mind. What did he always say after-
        \n\n
        Irelia flung herself into a backflip, the razor edge of a knife slicing through the space her head had just occupied. She landed in a crouch as a second knife raced through the air toward her. She beckoned to her father's blade, but it was nowhere to be found. Sensing danger, she managed to duck her head just enough to evade the point of the second projectile. She didn't flinch as the blade’s edge slid through her cheek.
        \n\n
        "...every ripple is the messenger of something yet to come." Master Lito appeared from the darkness, frowning behind his blindfold. Two more knives were clenched between the fingers of his left hand.
        \n\n
        "I smell blood."
        \n\n
        Irelia's jaw dropped. "Father?"
        \n\n
        "Don't try to hide it, I can hear your blood pattering on the shingles."
        \n\n
        Irelia looked down. The red clay tiles of the roof were unmistakable; this was her home. But she'd seen it succumb to the sickly green flames of Zaunite hextorches years ago.
        \n\n
        "You know what that means." Lito sheathed the blades in the blue folds of his robe. He inhaled sharply, his hands circling in front of him, channeling energy. Irelia did know what that meant: discipline.
        \n\n
        "Father, wait-", she began to say. The protest was futile. A loud snap announced his attack; Irelia was too slow to dodge. Though he stood twenty paces away, the long cloth from the sleeve of her father's training robe lanced out, lashing her squarely in the chest. She hurtled backward, sliding down the tiles. Catching her balance, she rolled back up the roof. Tiles cracked as Lito's unrelenting strikes thundered after her. He paused for a moment.
        \n\n
        "Messy. Your mind is clouded." Lito flicked his wrist, and cloth gripped her neck from across the roof. With another flick, he brought Irelia soaring toward him, yanking her off her feet. She could faintly see her father's devastating roundhouse kick coming to instill the day's final lesson, when a red blur appeared in front of it.
        \n\n
        "I thought I heard someone getting disciplined. You having trouble, Irie?" A voice gloated.
        \n\n
        "Zelos!" Irelia sputtered. Zelos was between them, his right arm blocking the roundhouse kick, and his left hand holding his father's sleeve so she could extract herself. The fabric released her neck.
        \n\n
        "Here, I brought something for you." He grinned at their father, who, though blindfolded, smiled back. "It's only fair."
        \n\n
        Zelos hurled a saber to her, but before she could grab it, Lito's other sleeve plucked it from the sky. He leapt, spinning horizontally in the air, reeling the weapon in. The spinning motion knocked Zelos to the tiles.
        \n\n
        "Alright, let's go!" Zelos brandished a sword of his own from a sheath strapped to his back and slashed at his father. The blow seemed to pass through Lito entirely. Irelia sprung to her feet, flipping forward with a devastating axe kick. Her heel met the flat of the saber Lito had intercepted. Zelos directed his energy into his own reverse roundhouse, and Lito was forced to block the blow with his arm. The saber clattered from the grip of his sleeve.
        \n\n
        Irelia wasted no time diving for the weapon. Lito's sleeve arced out as she'd expected, but this time she was ready. She landed on its cloth with her right hand, pinning it to the tiles. She twisted her body so that her foot could kick the hilt of the blade, bouncing it up in the air. Her other foot swung around in mid-air to kick against the back edge of the blade, launching the steel straight at Lito.
        \n\n
        He tore the blindfold from his face as the blade plunged into his stomach. His eyes were wide.
        \n\n
        "Irelia, what have you done?!" Lito choked.
        \n\n
        Irelia stared at him apathetically. "Had enough?"
        \n\n
        "Irelia, Dad's really hurt!" Zelos was incredulous.
        \n\n
        She nodded. "Well he does have a sword sticking out of him."
        \n\n
        Lito's pained expression vanished, replaced with a wry grin. "Why do you want to join the League, Irelia?"
        \n\n
        "My home was destroyed because I didn't have the strength to protect it. I will fight to the bitter death before I let something like that happen to Ionia again." Her tone was icy.
        \n\n
        "How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        Irelia laughed heartily, a sound she'd almost forgotten. "I thank you for allowing me to set eyes on my family again, but my father would never have let us land a blow. He joined the Elders by staying dry on this very roof during a rainstorm. According to the records, he never even moved. You can view the images in my mind all you like, but you'll never appreciate their true nature."
        \n\n
        Irelia found herself in the waiting alcove, doors closed in front and behind her. Her father's blade bobbed complacently beside her. With a flash, it split into four blades, throwing all the doors open around her. She drew a great breath, and strode into the League.

  <Champion name="Janna" title="The Storm's Fury" range="475" gender="f" rp="585" ip="1350" abilityVideoID="0040">
    <Story>There are those sorcerers who give themselves over to the primal powers of nature, forgoing the learned practice of magic. Such a sorceress is Janna, who first learned magic as an orphan growing up admist the chaos that is the city-state of Zaun. Janna eked out what living she could on the streets. Life was tough and dangerous for the beautiful young girl, and she survived by her wits, and by stealing when wits weren't enough. The rampant magic that characterizes Zaun was the first and most alluring tool which Janna realized could both protect and elevate her. Janna discovered that she had an affinity for a particular type of magic - the elemental magic of air. She mastered her studies of air magic in a matter of months, almost as if she was born of it. Janna went from a street vagrant to an avatar of the air virtually overnight, stunning and surpassing those who taught her. Such a rapid ascension also changed her physical appearance, giving her an otherworldly look.\n\nSeeking to right the injustice in the world (particularly the insanity that has become the city of Zaun), Janna has brought her talents to the League. She is a voice for the regulation of magical experimentation and a supporter of the development of techmaturgy, making her an indirect ally of the city-state of Piltover and the amazing techmaturgical minds that live there. Janna is also a new favorite of the League's many fans. She is often the center of attention at functions, fan appreciation days, and other celebratory events. There is something untouchable about Janna, however, and her affections can change as quickly as the wind.\n\nDo not be captivated by Janna's beauty. Like the wind, she is one gust away from terrible destruction.</Story>

  <Champion name="Jarvan IV" title="The Exemplar of Demacia" range="175" gender="m" rp="975" ip="4800" spotlight="RgOdf3x24qA" abilityVideoID="0059">
    <Story>As the royal family of Demacia for centuries, members of the Lightshield line have spent their lives waging war against any who opposed Demacian ethics. It is said that every Lightshield is born with anti-Noxian sentiment in his blood. Jarvan IV is no exception, even though he is the first Lightshield born to the age of the League of Legends. As his forefathers had before him, he led Demacian troops into bloody engagements with Noxian forces, and on many occasions he has bled alongside wounded allies and fallen comrades. In his most crushing defeat, he was outmaneuvered and captured by a Noxian battalion under the command of Jericho Swain. This mistake nearly cost him his life at the hands of Urgot, but he was rescued by the Dauntless Vanguard, an elite Demacian strike force led by Jarvan's childhood companion, Garen.\n\nThose close to him believed that his capture changed him. Xin Zhao was quoted as saying: ''His eyes never seemed to look at you, only through you to something he could not look away from.'' One day, without warning, Jarvan IV handpicked a squad of Demacian soldiers and left Demacia, vowing to find ''atonement''. He began by tracking and hunting the most dangerous beasts and bandits he could find in northern Valoran, but he soon tired of such prey. Seeking something that only he understood, he ventured south of the Great Barrier. He wasn't heard from again for nearly two years. After many had assumed the worst, he returned to glorious fanfare on the streets of Demacia. His Demacian plates were adorned with the bones and scales of creatures unknown. His eyes bore the wisdom of someone twice his age. Of the twelve soldiers who had departed with him, only two returned. In a tone as cold and steady as steel, he swore to bring the enemies of Demacia to their knees.\n\n''There is only one truth, and you will find it at the point of my lance.''\n- the ''last words'' of Jarvan IV at his failed execution</Story>

    <Judgment date="2 March, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        The Demacian junior summoner who was initially appointed to greet Jarvan, alas, experienced an unfortunate accident. He needed to be replaced at the last minute by a young summoner from Bilgewater with an eye for both coin and advancement. It seems the new boy penciled Jarvan in for an early Judgment, and judged he will be, though not by the League.
        \n\n
        He approaches the Great Hall reeking of arrogance. He, like his father, struts as though others should feel privileged to behold him. His armor is flashy and impractical, adorned with bits of slain beasts, a braggart without uttering a word. He has the jutting countenance of all the Lightshield dogs, men better built to wield clubs than authority. He is spoiled, haughty, and altogether undeserving of the respect laid at his feet.
        \n\n
        He marches to the chamber doors, a proud, strong beast in need of domestication. He steps through the portal, out of the light…and into the palm of my hand.
        \n\n
        Welcome Jarvan, I’ve waited a long time for this.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Royalty has its perks. The measured tones of his father, King Jarvan Lightshield the Third, interrupted Prince Jarvan’s thoughts. Despite his protests, the King had insisted that Xin Zhao recount his League Judgment in detail so Jarvan would know what to expect. This was against the mandates of the League, but, as his father put it, “a necessary infraction”. The test seemed hardly worthy once one knew the gimmick. Enter the room, be confronted by a disturbing vision of the past, and answer a couple questions. Jarvan was bitter about having his opportunity to fairly overcome the trial stolen. What worth is a Prince who cheats to best an obstacle surmounted by his subordinates? He frowned; it was an expression often denied to a leader of the public, but one befitting the dark, silent surroundings.
        \n\n
        Xin had described the Reflection Chamber as “thick with abyssal murkiness,” a depiction which had proven itself overdramatized. It was dark, yes, but altogether ordinary. The absence of light even failed to obfuscate some other person or entity present in the room. Jarvan was content to stand idle, letting him, her, or it carry on with the silly masquerade.
        \n\n
        On the opposite side of the cramped antechamber, the figure stood in the shadows. It couldn’t have been more than ten feet away from Jarvan. He paid it little attention, waiting for his vision to commence. However, instead of being swept into a fantastic mirage as he’d expected, Jarvan was left in the unremarkable blackness when the being attacked.
        \n\n
        Jarvan was unprepared. The form in front of him spread broad, onyx wings and lurched forward. Jarvan attempted to back into a defensive stance, but piercing talons dug up from the ground beneath him, stabbing into his legs and locking them in place. Black creatures swarmed through the air around him, pecking at his exposed flesh. Pain jolted his senses. The shade was upon him now, bearing down with unmistakable purpose. Six eyes burned redder than blood and hotter than embers above him, hatred sizzling the air around them.
        \n\n
        Swain.
        \n\n
        Jarvan ripped his legs free of the talons, heedless of the pain as they cut through his skin. His lance plunged forward, thirsty for the heart of its target. It met the winged figure’s chest, driving deeper and deeper. With a bloodcurdling cry, Jarvan lifted Swain into the air over his head and hurled him backward into the wall. The looming silhouette crashed against the cool stone surface and slid to the ground in a heap.
        \n\n
        Jarvan turned, venom welling in his eyes. “If you wanted a demonstration, you picked the perfect opponent!” He charged, intent on removing Swain’s head, illusion or not. He only managed to take one step before energy arced through the air, burning him through his armor. A charred smell filled the room as the beam rushed through him. He was enveloped in anguish, and he could not hear himself screaming.
        \n\n
        Torches lit around the room, and Swain, now human, stood where he had been thrown. His raven hovered in the air next to him, the bolt of energy surging from its mouth. A deep crimson stain was spreading across Swain’s chest.
        \n\n
        “I need no demonstration, Prince.” Swain spat the title as though it were a maggot in a bite of steak. “Your ‘unfortunate’ demise due to an oversight of the League will be quite satisfactory, and I have no doubt you’ll provide that. I wonder what your father will think of his treaty then…” He clenched his hands into fists and bright currents of magic appeared, flowing into them. He opened them and the magic burst forth, amplifying the raven’s power. Jarvan’s eyes went wide as the agony intensified. He fell to his knees.
        \n\n
        “You are so painfully foolish, Demacian. No tact, no finesse. It sickens me to call you my rival. I can’t wait to be rid of you, in hopes that a fitting opponent will rise to take your place.” As he spoke, Swain’s form began to shift. He was swelling, stretching, transforming hideously before Jarvan’s eyes. Ravens spawned from his body, descending on Jarvan and tearing him apart. As the birds swarmed, the torches in the room flickered, blinking out one by one. When the last torch was extinguished, all Jarvan could see were six bright, bloodthirsty dots on Swain’s disfigured head. The dots blurred together as his vision failed him, and eventually there was nothing left but blackness.
        \n\n
        Jarvan was in a place he’d been before, far from the Institute, at the lonely crossroads of life and death. He stood at the precipice of eternal peace, the gateway of slumber. He reached out, as he had many times before, to feel its warmth on his skin. Someday…not yet.
        \n\n
        Eyes shut, a sound grew from inside him, somewhere deeper than the body, deeper than the soul. It rippled outward, unfolding and cresting. It burst from his heart, burned through his veins, ignited his muscles. When it escaped his lips, it was a living thing, as formidable and furious as the ravens snipping at his flesh. The sound was filled with the voices of his ancestors. It was the battle cry of a Demacian warrior, the roar of a Prince. When the sound reached his ears, Jarvan’s eyes snapped open. They were no longer the eyes of a man. They heralded with fire the arrival of a beast, the awakening of a King. They came to focus on Swain.
        \n\n
        Jarvan leapt to his feet, snapping the grips of talons, shattering the clamps of beaks. He dove forward, abandoning his lance. Swain’s eyes betrayed surprise as Jarvan gripped his neck with one hand and lifted him from his feet. Jarvan kept moving, slamming Swain bodily into the wall behind him. He tightened his grip against the soft sensation of air struggling for passage beneath his fingers. He grinned wickedly at every choked gasp.
        \n\n
        “Tact? Finesse? In war there is only the victor and the dead, Noxian!” Jarvan was loosely aware of ravens ripping chunks from his body, carrying his life-force to Swain. He felt death creeping at the edge of his vision. He poured all his remaining energy into the vise grip, determined to not to die until he watched the life flee from Swain’s bulging eyes. The two were locked together, blood pooling on the floor, both unwilling to die before the other.
        \n\n
        “ENOUGH!!!” A voice rang out, echoing down the stone corridors of the Institute. Jarvan suddenly rocketed away from Swain, propelled through the air by an unknown force. He stopped just before he would slam the opposite wall, suspended four feet above the ground. Swain dangled at the same height on the other side of the room, now human. Save for his favorite pet, the ravens were all gone.
        \n\n
        High Councilor Vessaria Kolminye removed her hood and glared, first at Jarvan, and then at Swain. “What do you think you’re doing, Swain? This is a hallowed place. Your treacherous games will not be tolerated here.” She turned to Jarvan. “You will be accepted into the League for obvious reasons, but do not think your political ties will protect you against the League should you seek retaliation.” She gritted her teeth. “Pray I do not discover you again in the midst of such disrespect or you will yearn for the fates you plotted against each other this day.”
        \n\n
        Vessaria flicked her wrist and Swain tore through the air, swept from the room as casually as a hurled doll. Vessaria stormed out after him, shaking her head with disgust. Jarvan clattered gracelessly to the floor, grunting as his wounds cried for attention. He leaned on his lance, struggling to his feet. The doors to the League seemed miles away. He contemplated dying. While he gathered the will to limp onward, his father’s words echoed in his head. A weak smile played across his lips.
        \n\n

    <Story>It is seldom the case where a champion is defined by his actions after joining the League of Legends rather than before. Such is the case with Jax, for whom the argument could be made that he is the most prolific tournament fighter currently at the Institute of War. Before joining the League, Jax was an unremarkable soldier-for-hire. For reasons known only to the former leader of the League, High Councilor Reginald Ashram, Jax was put on the top of the list of candidates to receive a League Judgment - the interview process that either accepts or rejects a prospective champion. His Judgment was the quickest in League history, where the Doors of Acceptance glowed and slowly swung open as soon as it began.  Jax faced no recorded Observation or Reflection during his Judgment.\n\nJax proved himself to be an immediate terror in the Fields of Justice. The self-proclaimed ''Armsmaster of the League'' rattled off a streak of consecutive wins that to this day has not been matched. A number of summoners in the League grew concerned that the perceived objectivity of the League of Legends would be questioned by the presence of an unknown fighter who was unbeatable. For this reason, the new leader of the League (following Reginald Ashram's disappearance), High Councilor Heyward Relivash, created special restrictions for Jax to fight under. This was something the League had never done before, and something that has never been done since. The burly fighter responded by imposing his own special conditions; as a means of protest, he permitted himself to fight using only a brass lamppost. Neither the League's sanctions nor his own has affected his winning ways. The League has since rescinded its sanctions, but Jax has not; he fights and fights well with his trusty brass lamppost.\n\n''Be advised - there has been an outbreak of lamppost-shaped bruises in the League of Legends.''  - Gragas</Story>

    <Story>
      Armed with wit, charm, and his signature transforming hammer, Jayce lives to protect his native Piltover. Long before his nation called him a hero, however, he was a promising young inventor. When Piltover commissioned him to study a rare arcane crystal, Jayce discovered it could be used as a vast energy source. Eager to make a name for himself, he began developing a device to harness its power. Word of the crystal's potential reached beyond the borders of Piltover.  Viktor, the machine-augmented scientist from Zaun, brought Jayce an offer – together, they could use the crystal to advance his "glorious evolution," a vision of humanity fused with technology. Jayce refused, but the Zaunite had no intention of leaving empty handed. He effortlessly blasted Jayce aside and seized the crystal, incinerating the lab's meager security force as he left for Zaun. Jayce implored the Piltover government to respond, but the officials refused to support an act of aggression. He decided to act alone, realizing that if no one struck back, Piltover would never be safe.
      \n\n
      Jayce returned to the lab to prepare for his attack. After intense research, development, and hands-on testing, he emerged with his crowning achievement – the Mercury Hammer. Weapon in hand, Jayce marched to Zaun and began his one-man assault. Viktor's acolytes rushed to stop him, but Jayce smashed them aside, fighting his way into the heart of the lab. Inside, Jayce saw the horrifying brilliance of Viktor's creations, all powered by the energy of the arcane crystal. He realized that his only option was to destroy the power source, but Viktor stood in his way. Though their clash left both scientists heavily wounded, Jayce managed a desperate strike at the crystal. He shattered it and escaped as Viktor's machines erupted in flames. When he returned home, exhausted but victorious, the citizens of Piltover hailed Jayce as a hero. He reveled in the adoration, but knew that his actions had drawn the attention of dangerous enemies. Now devoted to the defense of his people, Jayce is Piltover's best hope for a bright future.
      \n\n

    <Story>Even in her youth, Karma exhibited almost superhuman composure. While her peers explored the torrent of emotions that came with adolescence, Karma meditated in the Lotus Gardens. She was convinced that the true path to enlightenment was a journey inward, to a place within the self, overlooked by most. She exuded such inner contentment that she quickly became a go-to mediator and confidante in her village. Her instructors used to say: ''That girl can not only weather a storm, but calm it.'' Karma did not live extravagantly; her parents owned a local business selling antiques in the Navori province and they often struggled to provide for themselves, though they did so with cheery optimism. Her most prized possessions were two exquisite fans taken from her family's shop.\n\nWhen Noxian troops invaded southern Ionia, her village was one of the first to fall. The villages who survived the assault were captured by Noxian forces. It was then that Karma found her calling. By exploiting the insecurities of the Noxian commander, she negotiated the safe release of the villages to the northern lands. She was present at the Placidium, where the Elders had considered surrender until Irelia's impassioned last stand renewed the Ionian's hope. Karma used this hope to solidify the Elders' commitment to remain defiant against the Noxian onslaught. For her devotion and charisma, Karma was made the figurehead of the Ionian resistance. She never compromised, and she shared every hardship with her people, even when it came to combat. By tapping into her inner resilience, she discovered that she could bring great force to bear against her foes on the battlefield. She modified her fans into lethal implements, and was tutored by Janna to enhance their effects. The Noxians called her, ''The Enlightened One,'' a nickname she embraced, and one which they would come to dread. She joined the League to represent Ionia in the ultimate political arena.\n\n''Her fan technique is a deadly art of grace and poise, but her truest strength lies in the hearts of those willing to die alongside her.''\n-Irelia</Story>

    <Judgment date="28 January, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Karma emerges into sight on the wings of prestige. From the topmost tip of her mantle to the lowest hem of her gown, she is the perfect picture of Ionian class. She pauses, poised at the threshold, admiring the delicate ornamentation that League artisans crafted into the Great Hall. Karma has seen the Great Hall on numerous occasions, but her eyes manage to well with appreciation in every instance. As she crosses the hall, grace drips from every movement, and she wades in an air of distinction.
        \n\n
        At the marble doors, she touches the frame delicately. They part gently for her, as if they were trying to match the elegance of her motion. She vanishes through the archway, and the room left behind feels emptier than it had before she entered.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The meticulous artistry of the Institute always reminded Karma, by curious contrast, of the chaos of open war. Every inset groove was, to her, the face of a lost friend. She imagined what her fallen comrades might have thought of this comparison when a horribly familiar, acrid stench stung her nose. She turned in time for a brilliant green explosion to fill her view. She swept her steel fans against the blast, piercing a hole in its expanding wave. Her reaction, though immediate, only diminished the force. She focused her senses inward as air whipped past. Her form was steel while her hair and clothes swirled in the chaos. When the blast subsided, her once-immaculate locks hung in limp disarray and her dress was torn and caked with soil.
        \n\n
        There was something unusual about the soil – a pungent smell. Blood. She looked up, bracing for the worst. Nonetheless, she was unprepared for what she saw. No, no...not again. In front of her, as far as she could see, lay the strewn bodies of Ionian villagers. Another green explosion in the distance sent cadavers arcing through the air. The taste of salt stung her lips. She didn’t even notice the tears tracing down her cheeks. She saw a shoe, much too small for any adult, raised from the ground ahead of her. A small leg extended beneath it, disappearing into the soil.
        \n\n
        Karma snapped upright, raking the air around her with both fans. Tears and soil matted with blood flew away from her. When all settled she was transformed, emotions absent, eyes dark but calm. She was powerful, noble, the picture of dignity against a backdrop of unimaginable horror.
        \n\n
        She strode with purpose towards a cackling figure in the distance. Its silhouette was one she could not forget: Zaun’s insane chemist, Warwick. He stood behind a glowing control panel atop an armored, beetle-shaped vehicle. He gesticulated with zeal as each explosion bit the Ionian landscape. He was human, although the lacking lycanthropy did not register with Karma. She was beyond thought, beyond emotion; ready to do what she must to stop what was happening in front of her.
        \n\n
        Zaunite shock troops assembled before her, blocking her path. A wave of her fan and they were gone, their cries muted by the roaring gust. Warwick noticed her with glee. His fingers danced across the controls and a cannon extended from the transport beneath him. It fired a sickly green stream of liquid into the air above her, where it burst like a liquid firecracker. She thrust one fan into the air above her head, blowing back a portion of the falling ooze, though far less than she’d expected. Drops rained down around her. Where the drops touched her skin, they sizzled and burned through it. Karma cried out in agony.
        \n\n
        “Delicious isn’t it, Duchess?” Warwick exclaimed. “I call it an Aerial Corrosive Mine. The acid is several times heavier than mercury, so your wind techniques won’t protect you.”
        \n\n
        Karma crumpled to the ground, the acid boring into her flesh. She pushed herself up to a cross-legged meditative pose, blinked back the searing pain, and uttered a healing mantra. The pain lessened, although it still consumed her.
        \n\n
        “It’s not meant to be fired into the air that way. I just wanted you to savor the taste. I’m afraid when I fire it directly at you, your delicate ‘weapons’ will be useless.”
        \n\n
        A tinny voice chirped something indiscernible from the control panel. Warwick listened for a moment, and then nodded his head. “I would truly love to play with you some more, Duchess, but there are more Ionians in need of my services.” Warwick fiddled with the controls and the cannon lowered, aimed squarely at her. “This ends now.”
        \n\n
        Karma blinked. Her mind was sluggish, flooded with frantic damage reports from nerves all over her body. A single thought floated to the surface of her awareness.
        \n\n
        I’ve failed.
        \n\n
        Just as she consigned herself to join those scattered around her, a blinding ray of light descended from the heavens, landing squarely on Warwick. He screamed as his skin melted away. His body contorted, muscles bursting outward. His head and limbs stretched, yanking joints apart and forming new ones. Long claws cut through the tips of his fingers and toes. He wrenched forward, then back, and when the spasms ceased his spine was long and hunched. His high-pitched wail suddenly turned to gravel, and blue hair stabbed out from every pore of his body. He fell to the ground in a heap. The light subsided.
        \n\n
        Not far from him, a new form lay in the mud. Karma fought her way to her feet, acid still eating into her, and stumbled to the form. There in front of her laid Soraka, the spiritual icon of her people. The Starchild had lost the celestial radiance which characterized her transcendence. She lay staring upward, her expression vacant.
        \n\n
        Reason overpowered remorse, and suddenly Karma knew she was seeing an illusion.
        \n\n
        Soraka’s gaze turned to Karma, her eyes piercing her soul for answers. “Why do you want to join the League, Karma?” The voice was sad, resigned.
        \n\n
        “Is this vision not enough?” Karma gestured all around them. The pain was suddenly gone. “This isn’t really over. These things never really end. All we can do is remain vigilant and try to protect those we love.”
        \n\n
        “Always one for a speech.” Soraka smirked. “How does it feel, exposing your mind?”
        \n\n
        “There is nothing on my mind that I wouldn’t happily share with you. How does it feel, knowing what we suffered, what you chose to ignore?”
        \n\n
        Karma was suddenly alone in the antechamber of the Institute, the doors ahead opened to the League. She appraised her clothes, which were as pristine and spotless as when she entered. With an imperceptible shift, Karma summoned her composure and marched onward.

  <Champion name="Karthus" title="The Deathsinger" range="450" gender="m" rp="975" ip="3150" abilityVideoID="0030">
    <Story>The vast quantities of physical magic that were consumed and destroyed during Valoran's numerous Rune Wars have scarred much of Valoran.  Many locations far from civilization have been morphed into hazardous and dangerous locales.  The Howling Marsh is one of these places, and the self-appointed overlord of this land is the lich known as Karthus.  It is thought that Karthus was a mage who, in life, was foolish enough to enter the fetid waters seeking his fortune, and that he was forever transformed by whatever dark magic permeates the swamp.  Karthus now rules over his swampy dominion with an iron (albeit skeletal) fist.  Visitors are not welcome, and those who are not scared away by the lich's terrible power most likely end up as one of the undead themselves... skeletons and zombies in Karthus' growing army of eternal servants.  On the darkest of nights, Karthus is said to sing the tales of those who have succumbed to the swamp, past and present.\n\nKarthus' tenure in the League of Legends is one of the more unusual ones in the history of the League.  First, it is highly unusual that a lich who was known for isolation and hatred of life would even be a willing part of an organization which promoted the preservation of life.  Next, Karthus specifically eschews the accrual of power and influence gained through service to the League; he is essentially an unpaid volunteer.  This behavior is completely different than what his life outside of the League would have onlookers believe.  Karthus has never spoken about his intentions in being a champion of the League, and in fact becomes quite agitated when asked about it.  In the interests of not aggravating a lich, most sensible people subsequently drop the issue.\n\n''Come visit my home, and I shall sing a dirge of your life as it once was.''</Story>

  <Champion name="Kassadin" title="The Void Walker" range="125" gender="m" rp="975" ip="3150" abilityVideoID="0038">
    <Story>There is a place between dimensions and between worlds. To some it is known as the Outside, to others it is the Unknown. To most, however, it is called the Void. Despite its name, the Void is not an empty place, but rather the home of unspeakable things, horrors not meant for minds of men. Though such knowledge is lost in modern times, there are those who have unwittingly discovered what lies beyond, and they have been unable to turn away. Kassadin is such a creature. He was once a man forced to look upon the face of the Void and forever changed by what he saw. Once a seeker of forbidden knowledge, he discovered that what he sought was something else entirely. He is one of the few that has found his way to forgotten Icathia and lived to tell the tale, following the scant breadcrumbs hidden in ancient texts.\n\nWithin a decaying cyclopean city, Kassadin found secrets of the kind that he will never share - secrets that made him quake with fear at the visions of things to come that were thrust upon him. The power of the place threatened to consume him forever, but Kassadin took the only route available to him in order to survive - he let the Void inside him. Miraculously, he was able to overcome the alien urges that went with it, and he emerged as something more than human. Though a part of him died that day, he knows that he must protect Valoran from the things scratching at the door, waiting to get in and visit their torments upon the world. They are only one step away... something to which the appearance of the abomination known as Cho'Gath attests.\n\nIf you look upon the Void, you can't put it behind you. If you look upon Kassadin, he is probably already there.</Story>

    <Story>As a militaristic state, it would perhaps come as no surprise that the primary responsibilities of Noxian women are raising strong children and providing succor for husbands who walk the path of soldiery. There are some, however, for whom nurture is not nature, and Katarina is just such a creature. Born the daughter of the feared Noxian General Du Couteau, the girl was always more interested in her father's knives than in the dresses, jewelry, and other trifles that her sisters spent so much time fussing over.  A childhood dispute soon unveiled her uncanny knack for bloodshed, and her father, ever the opportunist, happily fostered her killer instincts. After training under the tutelage of the finest assassins the mighty city-state had to offer, Katarina first cut her teeth performing assassinations in the Ionian War. There, her ruthless mastery of the knife and dagger combined with her sadistic temperament to earn her the title Sinister Blade, a moniker that would follow her for the remainder of her career. She is most famous, however, for her exploits in the campaigns against Demacia, especially those surrounding her engagements with the nation's champion, Garen; a rivalry that began when she recovered the remains of Sion from a vanguard under his protection.\n\nWith the demand for warfare somewhat arrested by the tenuous peace settling over Valoran, Katarina sought the allure of violence in its last remaining haven: The League of Legends. Some might say it was an inevitability that Katarina's chosen path would draw her to become a champion of the League, continuing to enforce the will of Noxus and bring prestige of war to her noble family. There, she continues to perform her bloody work - esteemed and reviled, feared and adored.\n\n''The Sinister Blade of Noxus is like a black widow - beautiful, but deadly.'' - Garen, the Might of Demacia, following a skirmish in the field</Story>

    <Story>In a world far away where an ancient war still rages, Kayle was a great hero - the strongest of an immortal race committed to destroying evil wherever it could be found.  For ten thousand years, Kayle fought tirelessly for her people, wielding her flaming sword forged before time itself. She shielded her delicate features beneath her enchanted armor, the sole remaining masterpiece of an extinct race of craftsmen.  Though a beautiful, striking creature, Kayle, now as then, avoids showing her face; war has taken a terrible toll upon her spirit.  In her quest for victory, she sometimes would try to lift the wicked up from their morass of evil, but more than often she instead purged those she herself deemed beyond redemption.  To Kayle, justice can so often be an ugly thing.\n\nTen years ago, Kayle's war against evil was nearly won... until her rebellious sister Morgana, a pariah amongst their people, suddenly gained powerful new allies: magicians of a hitherto unknown world called Runeterra.  Morgana traded servitude to a number of the summoners in Runeterra's League of Legends for powerful new abilities that, if mastered, threatened to bring Kayle and her people to their knees. To save her world, Kayle had no choice but to make a pact with the League herself.  She approached the leader of the League, High Counselor Reginald Ashram, with a deal of her own.  In exchange for a thousand years of Kayle's service, Ashram halted all League interference on Kayle's world.  With Ashram's disappearance five years ago, Kayle has new causes on Valoran: find out who or what caused Ashram to disappear, defeat her sister Morgana upon the Fields of Justice, and bring her own brand of justice to the League of Legends.\n\n''In the League of Legends, Justice comes on swift wings.''</Story>

    <Story>There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated to the preservation of balance. Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe. This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world. Kennen is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Coursing the Sun - tirelessly conveying the justice of the Kinkou.\n\nKennen was born in Bandle City and it was said that in his first living moments he bolted first from the womb and second from the midwife who delivered him. His parents had thought that he would outgrow his boundless energy, but as he matured his energy found no limits and was matched only by his unnerving speed. Despite his astonishing gifts, he remained unnoticed (or at least uncaught, as he was quite the prankster) until, on a dare, he ran straight up the great outer wall of the Placidium. When word of this feat reached Kinkou ears, Kennen was quickly and quietly brought in for an audience. He found that the role of the Heart of the Tempest suited him, frenetically delivering both the word and the punishments of the Kinkou across the realm. He now works with his fellows Akali and Shen to enforce the balance of Valoran. This hallowed pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.\n\n''The Heart of the Tempest beats eternal...and those beaten remember eternally.''</Story>

    <Story>When the prophet Malzahar was reborn in Icathia, he was led there by an ominous voice which thereafter anchored itself to his psyche. From within, this voice bestowed upon him terrible purpose, and though Malzahar was no longer tormented by its call, the voice did not cease its unrelenting summons. This baleful beacon's gentle flicker -- now fastened to Runeterra -- drew forth a putrid beast that ambled across a threshold it did not understand, widening a fissure between the spaces which were never meant to meet. There amongst the haunting ruins of Icathia, Kog'Maw manifested in Valoran with unsettling curiosity. The spark which led him to Runeterra teased him still, urging him gently towards Malzahar. It also encouraged him to familiarize himself with his new environment, to the stark horror of everything he encountered on his journey.\n\nThe enchanting colors and aromas of Runeterra intoxicated Kog'Maw, and he explored the fruits of the strange world the only way he knew how: by devouring them. At first he sampled only the wild flora and fauna he happened across. As he traversed the parched Tempest Flats, however, he came upon a tribe of nomads. Seemingly unhampered by conventional rules of physics, Kog'Maw consumed every nomad and any obstacles they put in his way, amounting to many times his own mass and volume. The most composed of his victims may have had time to wonder if this was due to the caustic enzymes which stung the ground as they dripped from his gaping mouth, although such musings were abruptly concluded. When his wake of catastrophe reached the Institute of War, an enthusiastic Malzahar greeted him with an enticing prospect: taste the best Runeterra could offer...on the Fields of Justice.\n\n'If that's just hungry, I don't want to see angry.' --Tryndamere, the Barbarian King</Story>

    <Story>Every city has its dark side, even one whose reputation is already of a questionable hue. Noxus - though its name is already invoked with a mixture of reverence and revulsion - is no exception to this simple truth. Deep within the winding dungeons that honeycomb the earth beneath its dark, meandering streets lies the real underbelly of this sprawling metropolis, a haven for all manner of malevolence. Amongst the cults, covens, and secret societies that call this labyrinth their home, LeBlanc, the Deceiver, presides over the Black Rose, a remnant from a lost, yet similarly unscrupulous time in Noxian history. Ruthless and seemingly ageless, LeBlanc and her ilk were a mainstay in Noxian political affairs during the era before the militarization of the Noxian government. In those days, this guild of powerful magicians met in secret to further their hidden agenda, and to hone a craft more subtle than that preferred by those currently in power.\n\nWhile their exact motives have always remained mysterious, it was widely believed that the Black Rose was the true power behind the throne while the aristocracy still reigned in Noxus. When raw martial prowess became the ultimate determination of whose will held sway in the Empire, the Black Rose seemed to vanish overnight. Many believed that perhaps their time had simply passed, and that its members had put aside their quests for social and political dominance. When LeBlanc reemerged at the gates of the Institute of War, however, it became clear that these masters of shadow and flame had simply been bidding their time, waiting for a new global authority to emerge: the League of Legends.\n\n''The world is very different for those who cannot see beyond what is placed before their very eyes.'' -LeBlanc, the Deceiver</Story>

    <Judgment date="29 October, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        LeBlanc's measured strides carry her along the polished marble with unparalleled grace and decorum. Her ornate magician's garb, stylish and well-kept, lends her a stately appearance seldom seen outside of a royal court. In her delicate hands she clasps a long staff topped with a series of multi-faceted crystals suspended by an unknown force. Pinned in her lustrous hair sits another such crystal, scattering the torchlight in all directions as she passes.
        \n\n
        She comes to a halt in front of an ornate door, taking a moment to peruse the inscription. "The truest opponent lies within," she reads whimsically. The irony curls the edges of her lips to a brief smirk, but only for an instant. A moment later, her face is implacable once more; an emotionless puzzle, but still captivatingly beautiful. She reaches out a single perfectly manicured hand, easily parting the doors despite their obvious weight. She peers for a moment into the oppressive blackness before taking even strides into the murk.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The darkness grew cold. She pulled the robe close about her to ward off the chill, suppressing a slight shiver. A cowled figure shuffled by with a hooded lantern in its hands. In the dim lamplight she could make out the stones and mortar on either side. Water was dripping somewhere further off, and the stink of mildew filled her nostrils.
        \n\n
        Another shadowy figure shambled by her, part of a procession. Falling in behind the rest of her ilk, LeBlanc took a moment to examine herself. Draped over her traditional court finery was a jet black cloak, bound with an onyx black rose. Her staff was gone, as was the brooch in her hair. Ahead, the tunnel broadened into a chamber, and she could see a crowd forming in the darkness. LeBlanc pushed her way through to the front. The crowd parted before her and she gasped. There, in the middle of the throng of onlookers, she stood face to face with herself. Well, herself in a manner of speaking. The situation was instantly familiar, and she waited patiently for her moment to come.
        \n\n
        One of the hooded onlookers stepped forward, addressing the doppelganger. "LeBlanc," he rasped to the woman at the center of the circle, "Why have you summoned us? These are dangerous times for the Black Rose to meet in numbers."
        \n\n
        The woman opened her mouth to speak, but a sharp wheeze cut her short. She snatched an embroidered handkerchief, speckled in blood, from the folds of her dress and used it to stifle a cough. She cleared her throat. "Brothers and sisters," she spoke weakly, "I have summoned you because I am old, and I have grown frail. I shall be one with the earth soon." She smiled, "The time has come for me to abdicate my position as Matron of the society." She coughed again, louder this time.
        \n\n
        "There is one among you who has shown great promise and leadership," she continued, "One whose talents are outstripped only by her ambition and loyalty." She plucked the sparkling brooch from her hair, and the illusion fell away. Her porcelain skin turned ashen, her hair thin and stringy, and her eyes sunken. She extended a wrinkled hand towards LeBlanc, "Evaine, step forward and be recognized." LeBlanc stepped forward, accepting the bauble and nestling it into her neatly styled hair. Her predecessor offered her the staff. "Strange," remarked the old woman, "It's like looking in the mirror." LeBlanc accepted the staff, and the scene about her fell away.
        \n\n
        A moment later she was sitting in her study, the staff cradled delicately in the crook of her elbow as she sipped tea from an ornate cup. Across from her sat a decrepit figure, his fragile body enveloped in a tightly pulled military garb. A large raven sat perched on his shoulder.
        \n\n
        "To what do I owe the pleasure of this visitation, Jericho Swain?" she asked. Swain's crooked hand curled around the handle of his teacup and he put the steaming hot beverage to his lips.
        \n\n
        "Exquisite," he rasped. "Matron LeBlanc, you have always had impeccable taste."
        \n\n
        "I have," she agreed with a smile; but there was only sadness in it. She stretched an arm across the table, clasping his scarred hand in hers. "But then, you already knew that. You knew it before you sold yourself."
        \n\n
        Swain pressed a thorned onyx ring into her hand. "It is true. I have made sacrifices. But I made them for us. The Black Rose is yours, Matron, but I have become something greater." As if in agreement, the raven on his shoulder cawed. "The time has come. Join me in fellowship, and we can restore what was taken from us by Boram Darkwill."
        \n\n
        She gazed at the ring, "You have forsaken your identity to gain Darkwill's trust. The rest will not be so eager."
        \n\n
        "Perhaps. But there are other ways," Swain continued.
        \n\n
        A porter arrived in the doorway to announce an additional guest. "General Du Couteau is here to see you, Matron."
        \n\n
        LeBlanc shot Swain a curious glance. "Send him up," she replied. The porter exited the study. "Du Couteau is that vulgar General's lapdog," she spat. "He will be of no use to us, Jericho."
        \n\n
        "Perhaps you're mistaken, Deceiver. He is of noble blood," said Swain.
        \n\n
        LeBlanc held up the ring. "But he is not one of us!"
        \n\n
        Swain nodded. "Why do you want to join the League, LeBlanc?"
        \n\n
        "I mean to reclaim my people's birthright," she proclaimed, flames burning in her eyes, "And believe me. I shall succeed."
        \n\n
        Jericho Swain got up from the table and gently caressed her face. "How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        LeBlanc threw back her head and laughed. "You think that I'm exposed, summoner?" she jeered. "You will never know LeBlanc. She is far older than I. She is older than your precious League." Swain nodded. The doors before her flew open, leaving her alone in the light. The League of Legends awaited her.

    <Story>As a young teen, Lee Sin was intent on becoming a summoner. His will and dedication were unmatched by any of his peers, and his skill drew the attention of Reginald Ashram, the League's High Councilor at the time. While studying at the Arcanum Majoris, Lee Sin became frustrated with instruction paced for the other students. He spent his free time researching the nuances of summoning in hopes of graduating sooner. He made amazing advances in his arcane studies, surpassing all other students. By all indications, he would have become one of the League's greatest summoners were it not for one terrible mistake. Too impatient, he attempted to test his ability by summoning a beast from the Plague Jungles. What he summoned instead was a young boy, but not in one piece. He barely had time to look the boy in what was once his face before the jumbled human mass fell lifeless to the floor. A League investigation later revealed that the boy's entire village was obliterated by feedback from the ritual.\n\nLee Sin's talents were so promising that the League was willing to overlook the incident, but he could never forgive himself. He left the Institute and journeyed to the Shojin Monastery for eternal repentance, swearing never to practice magic again. Years later, hoping to atone for his crime with martyrdom, he set himself ablaze as a protest of the Noxian occupation of Ionia. He remained alive in this state, enduring searing agony for weeks. His actions paved the way for a League match wherein Ionia prevailed, but by the time he was doused, his eyes had been burned completely from their sockets. Hailed as a savior, he was reborn, and his will to act invigorated. He joined the League of Legends to continue his atonement with sweat and blood, a true monk's only possessions.\n\n''The actions of one may sunder the world, but the efforts of many may rebuild it.'' - Lee Sin</Story>

    <Judgment date="31 March, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Lee Sin crosses the Great Hall with an aura of confidence unusual for a blind man. He seems to gather sensory information so efficiently it makes one wonder whether, for him, blindness is a weakness or a strength.
        \n\n
        His physique is exceedingly understated, tuned only for practical use by years of martial study. What he lacks in size, he makes up for with presence. His conviction is absolute. He pads straight to the doors, then stomps the ground. His head moves up the door, tracking the resulting sound.
        \n\n
        He chuckles at the inscription.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        A damp echo trickled outward as the doors thud shut behind Lee Sin, painting the room’s cramped dimensions in his mind. The sound was low and the air was stuffy, distorting the noise and accenting his mental image with a subtle blur. In the crannies of the musty stone, fading but distinct human scents lingered, the trace pheromones of violent emotion.
        \n\n
        But Lee Sin was transfixed on the overwhelming stench of ready magic.
        \n\n
        Arcane potential loomed in the air around him, more than he had ever sensed before. The Reflecting Chamber swelled with it. To most, it would be imperceptible, likely misinterpreted as jitters or dread. It had the quality of the calm before the storm: a pregnant stillness, a swindling serenity. Lee Sin knew that this room, in its current state, was an amplifier, an accelerant for sorcery. He could taste the magical anticipation, like a static charge waiting to be released.
        \n\n
        The aroma of fresh pine was suddenly everywhere. He stepped back.
        \n\n
        And fire engulfed him.
        \n\n
        The sensation was familiar more than anything else. Before the frantic damage reports arrived from nerves all over his body, he shut down part of his mind. He refused the pain access. Now there was only intensity and focus. Here he was again, amidst the flames.
        \n\n
        In a disturbing way, it felt like home.
        \n\n
        Five months had passed since he began the protest of the Noxian occupation in Ionia. He lit, without any pretense of survival, the pyre that consumed his flesh for two months. In that time, with agony tugging at his sanity, Lee Sin discovered things which hid deep within the soul, inner truths that revealed themselves only in the face of certain annihilation. Just before the lapping flames were to claim his final breath, his fellow monks arrived with the news that Ionia was free.
        \n\n
        “It was a cleansing fire, wasn’t it?” He recognized the bold timbre of his former mentor, Reginald Ashram, as acutely as the blaze surging around him. Ashram was one of the few people in Valoran privy to the secrets of Lee Sin’s past.
        \n\n
        “Pain does not heal the heart, it only focuses the mind.”
        \n\n
        “In this case, it focused many minds, and led to Noxus’ withdrawal from Ionian territory.”
        \n\n
        “A happy turn of events.” Lee Sin smiled, although the flickering heat on his face made him wonder if Ashram could see it.
        \n\n
        “But you still haven’t forgiven yourself.”
        \n\n
        Lee Sin sank to a meditative pose and the fire billowed in return. This, ironically, was his sanctuary.
        \n\n
        “The past remains, no act will undo it.” His tongue knew these words like the grooves of his teeth.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Lee Sin?”
        \n\n
        “I have much yet to do.”
        \n\n
        “Explain.”
        \n\n
        Remaining seated, Lee Sin raised one hand to his chest, fire dancing upon it. He swept it forward so sharply that the pyre flickered, and the flames on his arm were completely extinguished.
        \n\n
        “A decisive strike may finish a battle,” He paused as flames crept back up his outstretched arm, “but the evils of this world persist. To combat them, we must remain diligent.” The fire reached his hand again, and he closed it with such force that a shock wave rippled out, expunging the blaze that consumed him. The wave whipped across Ashram, and he took a half-step back.
        \n\n
        “How did you survive that fire?”
        \n\n
        “I found the purpose I had lost so long ago.”
        \n\n
        “And what is that purpose? What is your ultimate goal?” There was an urgency in Ashram’s voice, a hint of concern that puzzled Lee Sin. Ashram felt threatened.
        \n\n
        “One does not need a destination to have direction. Is a drop of water finished when it flows from the brook to the ocean? Is it complete when it rises to join the clouds? Has it failed when it falls upon the land?” An obliging drop of sweat rolled down his forehead.
        \n\n
        “What is your direction?”
        \n\n
        “To do what is right. To protect the overlooked things which matter most.” The drop of sweat hovered on the edge of his brow. “You can find them in the bubbling of the brook, the shade of the passing cloud, or the coolness of the rain.” On cue, the drop fell to his waiting palm.
        \n\n
        Ashram phrased his response carefully. “Your protest moved all of Valoran to action. Nearly to military action. This is a tremendous amount of power for one man to wield. What happens if that one man’s intentions become corrupt?”
        \n\n
        “Then I hope other men find the good in themselves to do what is right.”
        \n\n
        The inquisitor reeked of frustration. He was unused to vulnerability, uncomfortable with all that Lee Sin could perceive.
        \n\n
        “How does it feel to expose your mind?” The question was bitter and hollow, deprived of its usual gravitas.
        \n\n
        “I would ask you the same question.”
        \n\n
        Silence ensued.
        \n\n
        Lee Sin knew he was alone. The magical potency was gone, spent, and in its place sat an atmosphere of somber fatigue. This was the emotional residue of those who had completed the trial before him. Its flavor was bittersweet.
        \n\n
        In one graceful, fluid motion, Lee Sin was on his feet. His clothes and skin were intact, as though untouched by the flames. A fresh breeze swept through the room. Lee Sin could sense the shape of its current as it moved, like a serpent returning to coil in its nest.
        \n\n
        Lee Sin lingered a moment, head bowed in appreciation of the champions who had passed this threshold before him.
        \n\n
        One life past, one life ahead.
        \n\n
        So the Blind Monk joined the League of Legends.

    <Story>On the upper slopes of Mount Targon, the warriors of Rakkor live and breathe only for war.  However, Targon's peak is reserved for a special group of Rakkoran who answer to a ''higher'' calling.  Members of this group, called the Solari, retire their mantles of war, choosing instead to devote their lives to reverence of the sun.  According to legend, the Solari were formed by a warrior who could call the raw might of the sun down upon his enemies in combat.  He claimed Mount Targon's summit, the point on Valoran closest to the sun, for his solar devotion, a tradition which generations of Solari have preserved to this day.  Though they maintain their reverence, no other warrior possessed the gifts of the founder -- until Leona.\n\nLeona's parents were traditional Rakkorans, both bred for the heat of battle.  To them, Leona was a problem child.  She was capable of fighting as fiercely as any other -- including her childhood friend, Pantheon -- but she did not share their zeal for killing.  She believed that the true worth of a soldier lay in her ability to defend and protect.  When it came time for her Rite of Kor, a ceremony in which two Rakkoran teens battle to the death for the right to bear a relic-weapon, Leona refused to fight.  For this, the Rakkoran leaders ordered her execution, but when they tried to strike the fatal blow, sunlight burst forth, bathing Mount Targon in light.  As it faded, Leona stood unharmed and her executioners lay unconscious around her.  The Solari immediately claimed Leona, demanding that her sentence be repealed.  She donned the golden armor of the Solari and they bestowed upon her the sword and shield passed down from the ancient sun-warrior of legend.  The Solari helped Leona focus her abilities, and when she was ready she left to join the League of Legends.\n\n''The sun's rays reach all of Runeterra, so too must the image of its champion.''\n-Leona</Story>

    <Judgment date="1 July, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Leona’s movements are smooth, calculated. Her walk, though elegant, is not the trained gait of nobility. Her steps are meant for war.
        \n\n
        Although her armor and form lend her an air of sophistication, it’s evident that she has never seen a place like the Institute of War. She runs a finger along the smooth etchings in the marble doors of the Reflection Chamber, and starts when they glide open. Overcoming reluctance, she steps into the tendrils of darkness reaching to embrace her.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Reflexively, Leona channeled energy into her shield, willing the sun’s light to emanate from it. Though she was sure of her technique, she remained swathed in darkness. No child of the Rakkor fears the shadows, but Leona felt uncharacteristically vulnerable deprived of the sun’s rays. Had she become so reliant on its presence already? The memory of her awakening still felt fresh, even though the sun had since completed nearly half its cycle.
        \n\n
        A stiff wind called up familiar goose bumps on her skin, and she was there again, on the snowy slopes of Mount Targon, the day of realization. Targon’s wintery breeze carried with it the pungent stench of blood, as lives of “unworthy” teens were claimed by the Rite of Kor. It was a grisly ceremony, though for Targon’s limited food supply, a necessary one. Until the solstice of their 16th year, every Rakkor child was trained and taught in preparation for their momentous battle.
        \n\n
        Leona knew every boy and girl who had fallen that day. She tried to ignore the crippling concern that their deaths may have been her fault. She had, more than once, stood between them and the more aggressive children. She delighted in thwarting bullies. Had she been selfish? Her instructors insisted that every battle missed was a lesson lost, that she was doing more harm than good. But Leona couldn’t sit idly by while her friends suffered.
        \n\n
        Now they were dead. Maybe the instructors were right.
        \n\n
        She searched the eyes of watching parents, wondering how they could allow their children to be slaughtered. She later realized that the Kor was as much a test for those observing as it was for the participants. It was a ritual about understanding and accepting the Rakkor way of life. To succeed was to earn your place amongst the tribe, to be trusted to wield the terrifying relic-weapons of your ancestors, to be prepared for the sacrifices that would be expected of you. To fail was to enrich Rakkor soil with your body and blood. Even in death, you would serve the tribe.
        \n\n
        It was her turn now.
        \n\n
        All around the pit, warriors beat their shields, screaming and cheering against the roar of the wind. The cold bit to the bone. Leona was given a small buckler and a short sword. Her opponent, Molik, was armed with a spear and shield.
        \n\n
        Molik was a poor fighter, all things considered. He was slow and he hadn’t mastered his footing. A well-timed sweep never failed to topple him. He was one of the boys Leona defended before, and now she would be his executioner. His parents stood out amongst the crowd, faces grim. They knew the failures of their son. Leona’s own parents watched with anticipation. Today their concerns about her would be put to rest. Her reluctance to conform would either be pushed aside or taken to the grave. Compassion had no place with the Rakkor.
        \n\n
        Leona didn’t want to die.
        \n\n
        She looked at Molik. His gaze was steel. In any other place or time, he would be wearing a goofy smile and confiding in Leona his passion for woodworking. His skill with a carving knife was enviable, though it didn’t translate at all to the sword. Now, he was a warrior of the Rakkor – emotionless and unmerciful.
        \n\n
        With a cry from the leader, the combat commenced. Molik bellowed and lunged forward, spear aimed for her heart. She deflected the blow with the buckler and kicked him hard in the shins. Molik yelped and fell forward, managing to roll to a crouch. He swept the spear around, hoping to catch Leona off balance, but she was far too fast for him.
        \n\n
        She raised one leg and stomped hard, splintering the end of the spear beneath her bare foot. Molik reared up, swinging the shield in a broad arc. His movements were slow, predictable. Leona dove into the blow, ducking beneath his shield. Inside his defenses, she struck him in the ribs with the flat of her blade. He doubled over, clutching his side with his shield arm. She leveled her sword in his face.
        \n\n
        His defeat, though expected, was disappointing. She caught his father’s gaze and all she could see was shame. Molik himself looked ready to cry. He knew this would be his final day, but he’d hoped to die with more dignity. He’d hoped his parents would cheer at his final fight.
        \n\n
        Leona couldn’t stand it.
        \n\n
        She hurled her sword and buckler to the ground and faced Jagen, the Kor leader.
        \n\n
        “Finish it,” he said, frowning.
        \n\n
        She locked eyes with him. “No.”
        \n\n
        The crowd fell silent. She could make out her mother’s horrified gasp. So much for her parents’ day. At least the shame of her actions would far overshadow Molik’s poor performance. Jagen nodded to Pantheon, who stood at his side spattered in blood from his own Kor. He was beside her in a single leap. He leaned close.
        \n\n
        "You need to do this, Leona.” This would be her only warning.
        \n\n
        She didn’t break eye contact with Jagen. “I won’t.”
        \n\n
        Jagen stepped down into the pit. “There is only one punishment for crimes against the tribe.” He waved a hand and spearmen surrounded Leona. “As you well know.”
        \n\n
        Leona exhaled. She tried in vain to decide what she would like her last thought to be. Instead she just let her head loll back, the sun filling her view. She swore she could feel its warmth cutting through Targon’s icy winds.
        \n\n
        Then her world became blinding light.
        \n\n
        She opened her eyes, expecting to see Jagen and the others sprawled across the ground as they had been that day. She expected to see the Rakkor gaping at her, their faces a mix of awe and terror. Terror was something she’d never seen on the faces of her elders before that day.
        \n\n
        Instead, Jagen stood in front of her. This wasn’t how the memory was supposed to go. He clutched the base of a spear in his right hand. She followed it to her stomach, where the tip disappeared into a growing red pool.
        \n\n
        Leona suddenly couldn’t breathe.
        \n\n
        “This was how it was meant to go, Leona.” Jagen’s voice lost its menace. Now it was oddly soothing, almost reassuring.
        \n\n
        She sputtered. Blood was pouring from her wound, her vision blurred.
        \n\n
        “Is this what you are without the sun?” He pressed against the spear.
        \n\n
        Until that moment, shock alone comprised her awareness. Now excruciating pain shot through her system. It was exactly what she needed.
        \n\n
        Her eyes came to sharp focus. In the years since her awakening, she had always regretted forcing the sun to come to her aid. She was Leona, the Radiant Dawn, and she was the sun’s avatar on Runeterra. It was her place to serve the sun, not vice versa.
        \n\n
        With a swift chop of her right hand, she snapped the shaft of the spear. Jagen’s eyes widened. Her fingers tightened into a fist and she backhanded him hard across the temple. He stumbled.
        \n\n
        “I am never without the sun.” She caught him squarely in the chest with a front kick, sending him to the ground. Then she was over him, letting her blood drip on his face. To her surprise, he laughed.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Leona?”
        \n\n
        She froze. He managed to take her completely by surprise.
        \n\n
        “Come now, why do you want to join the League?” His tone was jovial, triumphant.
        \n\n
        She took a long breath. “I am chosen of the sun. The League should feel privileged-“
        \n\n
        “I do believe that you’ve convinced yourself of that.” He smiled. “But there’s more to it.”
        \n\n
        Leona hesitated. Truth lurked behind his words.
        \n\n
        "You want to make it up to them,” he said. “The Rakkor children you failed to protect.”
        \n\n
        Leona bit her tongue.
        \n\n
        “How does it feel, exposing your mind?”
        \n\n
        Jagen knew he wouldn’t get a response. He vanished and she was in the Institute again, although she hardly noticed. She stood slumped for what felt like hours. Her shield hung weakly at her side. A faint light suddenly glowed from it.
        \n\n
        It hit her: perhaps the reason she had been spared was to do exactly as he said. She truly wanted to. Her shoulders rose, and the sun burned brightly from her shield. The League of Legends would indeed have the champion of the sun.

    <Story>
      Perhaps more than any other champion in the League, Lulu marches to the beat of her own drum. During her youth in Bandle City, she spent most of her time wandering alone in the forest or lost in a daydream. It wasn’t that she was antisocial; the day-to-day bustle of Bandle City just couldn’t compete with the vibrant world of her imagination. She saw wonder in places most people overlooked. This was how she found Pix, a fae spirit, pretending to be stuck in a birdhouse. Lulu’s imagination distinguished her to Pix, and he seized the opportunity to lure her into his life. He brought her to the Glade, the enchanted home of the fae, which lay nestled in a clearing in the woods. There the rigid properties of the outside world - things like size and color - changed as frequently and whimsically as the direction of the wind. Lulu felt at home in the Glade and she lingered there with Pix, fascinated by this secret place.
      \n\n
      She quickly lost track of time. Her life in the Glade was comfortable, natural. She and Pix played fae games together, the sorts of games that she had been told were “only pretend,” and she got exceedingly good at them. It caught her by surprise when she suddenly remembered that she had left a life behind in Bandle City. The Glade had a way of making everything outside seem distant and surreal. Lulu decided to revisit her former home, to share some of the lovely things she’d learned, but when she and Pix returned the world had changed. Time, she discovered, was another property that behaved differently in the Glade, and centuries had passed while she was away. Lulu sought to reconnect to the residents of the outside world, but her attempt had unfortunate results. She led all the children off to play hide and seek, temporarily changing them into flowers and animals to spice up the game, but their parents didn’t appreciate her efforts. When the yordles insisted that she leave their land, she turned to a vibrant, magic place where those with unusual gifts were not just accepted but adored: the League of Legends.

    <Story>Born to the prestigious Crownguards,  the paragon family of Demacian service, Luxanna was destined for greatness.  She grew up as the family's only daughter, and she immediately took to the advanced education and lavish parties required of families as high profile as the Crownguards.  As Lux matured, it became clear that she was extraordinarily gifted.  She could play tricks that made people believe they had seen things that did not actually exist.  She could also hide in plain sight.  Somehow, she was able to reverse engineer arcane magical spells after seeing them cast only once.  She was hailed as a prodigy, drawing the affections of the Demacian government, military, and citizens alike.\n\nAs one of the youngest women to be tested by the College of Magic, she was discovered to possess a  unique command over the powers of light.  The young Lux viewed this as a great gift, something for her to embrace and use in the name of good.  Realizing her unique skills, the Demacian military recruited and trained her in covert operations.  She quickly became renowned for her daring achievements; the most dangerous of which found her deep in the chambers of the Noxian High Command.   She extracted valuable inside information about the Noxus-Ionian conflict, earning her great favor with Demacians and Ionians alike.  However, reconnaissance and surveillance was not for her.  A light of her people, Lux's true calling was the League of Legends, where she could follow in her brother's footsteps and unleash her gifts as an inspiration for all of Demacia.\n\n ''Her guiding light makes enemies wary, but they should worry most when the light fades.''\n -- Garen, The Might of Demacia</Story>

    <Judgment date="17 October, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Lux runs briskly into the hallway, almost bursting with excitement. The light plays off of the young girl’s golden hair, emitting a brightness that almost gives her an ethereal air. Her colorful attire and disarming smile would fool any ignorant passerby, but the ease with which she wears her battle armor would give any seasoned warrior pause.
        \n\n
        She pauses for a moment to take in the scenery, her intelligent eyes darting around. An intricate baton darts rapidly between her fingers, conveying her impatience.
        \n\n
        The truest opponent lies within.
        \n\n
        An unimpressed “hmph” spills out of her lips. Striding forward, she pushes firmly with a gloved hand to open the marble doors before her. With an effortless spin of her baton, her body is enveloped in a bright aura. She runs inside, undaunted by the complete darkness that swallows her up.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Garen, the Might of Demacia, her long-lost brother, stood before her. His face was stern, yet kind, and exactly how she had imagined he would look in real life, having only seen him in the League match broadcasts since he had been taken away. “Why do you want to join the League?”
        \n\n
        Lux allowed herself a smile, trying to not seem smug. While anyone who had been subject to a League judgment was forbidden to discuss the trial, Lux had done her research, and she knew that they summoned illusions to extract their answers. It was mere child’s play for her; she could see right through it, and she knew what they wanted to hear.
        \n\n
        She straightened and looked the illusion of her brother straight in the eye. “To fight for justice in the name of Demacia.”
        \n\n
        “What is the real reason, Luxanna?”
        \n\n
        “Victory for our allies, defeat for our enemies, and justice for all.” They were both quotes from The Measured Tread, the handbook that any self-respecting Demacian could recite on command, but they did not make them any less true for her own purposes.
        \n\n
        Her brother frowned, and that was the last thing Lux saw before an explosion of light consumed them.
        \n\n
        It was happening again. Sometimes, the light would bounce off the glass hall of the Demacian Royal Academy, casting a bewitching display of prisms in every direction. Lux’s skin would shimmer, as if composed from the dust of crystals. Her mood lifted and she let the light envelop her, rendering her invisible in plain sight.
        \n\n
        She hadn’t yet gained control over the odd occurrence, which was unfortunate as it would happen at random intervals during the most inopportune of moments. Lux ran off in the direction of her home, heart racing in the hopes that the illusion would stick around long enough for her to show her parents. There was only a fleeting twinge of guilt that struck her for leaving school, but her teacher would count her as absent anyway.
        \n\n
        Lux burst into the Crownguard residence. To her delight, she heard familiar voices speaking quietly in the kitchen. She found three military officials standing at attention, speaking to her parents. Her heart skipped a beat as she started to retreat back into the living room; they were discussing important business, and she had been taught better than to interrupt. She would have left the house entirely, except at that one dreadful moment, she heard her name.
        \n\n
        She froze.
        \n\n
        “It is the greatest honor you could bestow upon our household to take Luxanna. She will serve you well, just as Garen has before her.” A chair scraped along the floor as her mother stood.
        \n\n
        “You are sure, Lilia? Your daughter is at the age where she needs her parents the most, especially after taking her older brother away.”
        \n\n
        “It is all in the King’s name. You will provide all the parenting that she will need.” Her father’s tone was dismissive.
        \n\n
        “Very well. It is done.”
        \n\n
        Lux fell to the ground, the repressed memories unforgivingly rushing back into her mind. Her parents delivering the news. Lux barricading herself in her room. The pain in her arms as they forcibly dragged her away from her home. Her hair draped across her face as she refused to look at her parents. The burn of her tears as she cried herself to sleep every night. The booming voices yelling at her to focus. Her screams as she cursed her family for doing this to her.
        \n\n
        Then, her own voice echoing back at her, reciting the Justice Pledge alongside her fellow recruits. The comfort of re-reading The Measured Tread cover to cover countless times. The indoctrination of the new incoming class, led by Lux herself. The pride swelling in her heart as she marched forth under Demacia’s shining banner. The accolades in praise of her exemplary work. The absolute love for her country. The emptiness of realization of what she had willingly grown to love.
        \n\n
        The assault of memories subsided, and she was left slumped in the darkness. She knew the League had retreated from her mind, but the test wasn’t over yet. Someone was standing before her, and she didn’t even have to look up to know who it was.
        \n\n
        “Will you admit the real reason why you want to join the League now?”
        \n\n
        Her labored breaths caught in her throat just long enough for her to whisper, “Because I have nothing else…”
        \n\n
        The darkness shattered around her, falling to the ground in shards. She crumpled to the ground, heaving sobs racking her body.
        \n\n
        Garen remained standing, his normally kind face gruff and unreadable as the illusion dissolved around them. “You have just shared your mind with me. To become a champion of the League, you must allow others into your mind, and they will know your true conviction and purpose better than you yourself. If you are prepared, you know what you must do.”
        \n\n
        Her brother turned and strode through the hallway that stretched before them to another set of double doors. He did not stop to lend her a hand, nor did he glance backwards to see if she would follow.
        \n\n
        He didn’t need to. Lux remained on the floor, composing herself. For a moment, she considered calling out to her brother or running back into the Great Hallway, out of the League’s penetrative gaze. This was the first challenge that ever daunted her, even moreso than when she was being tested by Demacia’s top magicians or sneaking through Noxus’s innermost tunnels. But she was a Crownguard, and she knew that she would overcome this challenge, just as she had overcome all other challenges in her life.
        \n\n
        She stood, clutching the baton deftly in her hand. She would prove that her dedication to her city-state was true, and that she had not been lying when she first answered their question.

  <Champion name="Malphite" title="Shard of The Monolith" range="125" gender="m" rp="585" ip="1350" abilityVideoID="0054">
    <Story>There is a world of perfect harmony, where all are part of the whole. The Monolith is the essence of all creation, and its denizens are but singular pieces of it. It is beautiful in its symmetry, and in its almost complete lack of uncertainty. The rocky beings that live there know their place and work to fulfill their duties to the fullest extent, functioning almost as a superorganism or hive. Malphite has always strived to live up to his full potential, as his own personal part of the whole, serving the role of a distinguished creature questing to enforce his people's flawless vision of order.\n\nOne day, without warning, a dimensional rift opened, and he was summoned across the cosmos to the world of Runeterra. The transition was painful and terrifying for him, as he was cut off from the song of his people and the Monolith - things that had been ever-present in him since the day he was born. He raged, trapped in the Summoning Circle, as those who had called him made their plea. Runeterra was a world that had nearly been consumed by its disharmony. It was a world that needed champions to bring order out of chaos. It was to that end that the rock-creature was summoned, so that he could aid them in this quest. Looking past his own fear and apprehension, Malphite could see that this was a respectable goal, and one in which he could participate - perhaps uniquely so. Today, as part of the League of Legends, he hammers those who would seek to upset Valoran's movement toward order, especially turning his attention to those that wield chaotic magic. Unfortunately, Malphite has also begun to change, as he has been forced to face his own profound loneliness among the world's vibrant individuality.\n\nBeware, minions of chaos! The Shard of the Monolith has come.</Story>

    <Story>Many men have gone mad beneath the glare of the Shurima sun, but it was during the night's chilling embrace that Malzahar relinquished his sanity.  Malzahar was born a seer, blessed with the gift of prophecy.  His talent, though unrefined, promised to be one of Runeterra's greatest boons, but destiny plotted him another course; his sensitivity to the roiling tides of fate allowed other, unwelcome things to tug at his subconscious mind.  In his dreams, where the veil of separation is thinnest, a sinister thing beckoned.  For some time, Malzahar was able to resist its prodding solicitation, but with each passing night the voice grew louder, or perhaps deeper, until he could withstand the call no more.\n\nHe ventured into the desert without supplies, drawn by the lure of a specious charm.  His destination: a lost civilization to the east, known to ancient texts as Icathia.  Few believed such a place ever existed, and those who did were certain that the sands had long since devoured whatever remained.  When Malzahar's cracked feet finally failed him, he found himself kneeling at the base of a bizarre crumbling obelisk.  Beyond it lay the alien geometry of a ruined city and the giant decaying idols of dark and horrific gods.  His eyes, seeing what others cannot, and what none should, were filled with the essence of the Void.  His once shifting visions of the future were replaced with the immutable promise of Valoran beset by creatures of the Void.  Standing alone, but not alone, amidst the echoing dunes, he noticed the familiar voice escape his own lips in a parched rasp, bearing three words whose weight trembled his knees.  League of Legends.  Now infused with the power of the void itself, Malzahar set off to the north to seek his fate.\n\n''The land may melt, the sea may swell, the sky may fall... but They will come.'' - Malzahar</Story>

    <Story>The twisting magical energies unleashed by mages during the Rune Wars caused an incredible amount of devastation to the natural world.  The League was established to control the use of this magic by confining it to the Fields of Justice.  By limiting its use to there, they thought that they could prevent it from doing further harm to the environment.  It seemed that they were successful until Maokai came into being.  During a League match on The Twisted Treeline, Maokai, an ancient oak that stood above the upper jungle, spontaneously roared to life.  Ripped from the natural balance by arcane forces, his sentience was forged in chaos.  Before the Adjudicators of the League could step in and suppress him, he slew all six champions participating in the match.  The scholars of the Arcanum Majoris took a keen interest in him, as they were eager to discover the secrets of his animation.\n\nMaokai was furious, however.  He abhorred the existence was that thrust upon him; he felt it was a corruption of nature.  He learned to communicate with people in hopes of finding a way to be returned to his former, true state.  Seizing the opportunity, the League offered a trade.  They would research a way to revert him so long as he agreed to fight in the League of Legends.  Maokai was indifferent to verdicts rendered by the League, but he was eager to punish summoners for their wanton use of magic.  He agreed to the terms under one condition: once they learned how to turn him back, they would never animate another tree again.  He wears a lantern on the Fields of Justice to set him apart from the other trees, and as a warning to the animals that would do him harm.\n\n''I will use this power until I am free of it.''\n  - Maokai</Story>

    <Judgment date="14 February, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        A frenzy erupts on the Twisted Treeline. Saplings scurry in every direction, detonating in multicolored explosions of arcane energy. League Champions and summoners alike rush onto the field to contain an uprooted tree that is not only moving, but also attacking everything in sight. The tree is visibly confused over his violent birth into awareness, and he involuntarily conjures an arcane storm of magic. The storm grows as it absorbs energy from the magical and physical attacks being directed at the verdant force, until suddenly the torrent explodes with enough power to kill everyone present.
        \n\n
        A bright orange light falls over the scene as Kayle appears, shielding the group from death. As the dust clears, the tree is contained in an earthen dome by League representatives, and immediately whisked away to the Institute of War for further examination.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The room Maokai found himself in was cavernous, with a reflecting pool stretching across the entire expanse of the floor. A human adorned in flowing purple robes stood in the middle of the room, reflections of light from the pool dancing across her.
        \n\n
        “An honor to make your acquaintance.” The woman bowed deeply, admiration glowing in her eyes as she beheld the treant. “I shall be administering your judgment for entry into the League.”
        \n\n
        Maokai exploded into a rage. "Judgment? You humans woke me, and created this abomination of life, and now you stand and judge me?"
        \n\n
        The summoner did not respond. She raised her arms and muttered an incantation under her breath. The floor swam beneath him, and suddenly the room dissolved away.
        \n\n
        His roots tingled with familiarity as he found himself standing in a large expanse of trees. The forest around him stood tall, with strong trunks and leaves of every color - this was his home as it had existed eons ago. He ached for what was long passed.
        \n\n
        Suddenly, the surrounding terrain exploded. The ground surrounding Maokai sunk and bubbled in grotesque ways. Vegetation as far as the eye could see began to melt with a sickening hissing sound. Humans were running panicked through the forest under a rain of bullets and chemicals. A boy fell to the ground, struck by a stray bullet. The summoner and Maokai were invisible to the chaos erupting around them, but somehow the boy looked straight at them, the life in his bright eyes quickly fading.
        \n\n
        The ground below Maokai changed again, accelerating until it became a blur. Maokai stood, trembling, as the scenery assaulted all his new found senses. The acrid odor of trees melting in a pool of acid. A beautiful island the color of the sky splitting asunder into three. A beautiful, ancient city of white quartz twisting into itself in impossible ways, defying the laws of time and space.
        \n\n
        Maokai closed his eyes, weary. The League must have assumed they were showing him something new, but it was nothing he hadn’t already known. He had stood for centuries, absorbing the pain and sorrow from the abuses wrought upon the land and the life in its soil.
        \n\n
        The summoner spoke quietly, holding the scene that flashed before them in reverence. “We do not ask for any of this, yet it is brought upon us by those who would do evil. By joining the League, you can help us prevent these things from happening.”
        \n\n
        Maokai’s disgust had not subsided. “You humans are the ones who are causing this. You ask me to feel for you when all I see is the hatred you bring onto yourselves. When you see your children being overrun with weapons, I see the fallen trees carved into your instruments of destruction. I see the land which has existed before you and which will continue to exist after you suffer for your petty squabbles.”
        \n\n
        “Knowing all this, would you still choose to go back?" She asked.
        \n\n
        The treant hesitated, surprising himself.
        \n\n
        “Or will you continue to stand, impassively, believing that you can affect none of this?”
        \n\n
        Her accusatory tone snapped him from his momentary hesitation. "Your wars are no concern of mine. You deign to awaken me to the pain you humans suffer, but before you gave me this curse I already knew your pain and suffering. When the earth absorbs the blood of your children, it cries. I have withstood this longer than you can even imagine. We of the earth do not feel, and thus I am not of the conviction to change how you humans live or die."
        \n\n
        The summoner's eyes darkened. It was not the response the League wanted, but it was the only one they were going to get. “Then what will you do?”
        \n\n
        “I will walk this path until you can turn me back, as promised.” He paused, and one could swear that something akin to a smile twisted the tree’s mouth. “Until then, I will punish you magic users with these hands you were kind enough to bestow upon me.”
        \n\n
        Composing herself, the summoner expelled the illusion with a sweep of her hands. "Very well. That is your answer." She turned on her heel and walked away without another word.
        \n\n
        Maokai watched her go, impassively. He noticed the young boy's blood from the illusion lingering in a puddle on the floor, though the body had been whisked away. The treant started to walk past it, but suddenly stopped and turned.
        \n\n
        With slow, deliberate movements, he yanked off a chunk of his roots and laid them gingerly in the pool of blood. The roots began to absorb the blood, slowly at first, and then desperately, as if the blood could not be held back. The roots jumbled together into a mess of knots, and then a sapling emerged. It looked up at him with innocent eyes.
        \n\n
        Another chance at life. Something inside the ancient tree moved, though what it was he had no idea.
        \n\n
        He knew that someday he would return to stillness, but things would never be the same.

  <Champion name="Master Yi" title="The Wuju Bladesman" range="125" gender="m" rp="260" ip="450" abilityVideoID="0011">
    <Story>Keeper of the ancient art of Wuju, Master Yi is a mystical warrior from the isle of Ionia.  He descended from one of the few tribes dedicated to the preservation of Wuju, a martial art founded with the principles of absolute spiritual awareness of one's self and one's enemy.  When the armies of Noxus invaded Ionia, Master Yi joined in the Ionian defense to fight the craven enemy, bringing his village honor through his unparalleled mastery of the blade.  The ensuing battles ravaged the land, but no conflict inflicted as much horror as the day the armies of Noxus closed in on Yi's village. Left undefended, the village became the unfortunate test subject of the latest invention by an up-and-coming chemist, now known as Singed. The remains of the village that Master Yi returned to were so horrific that it remains a festering scar on Ionian history.  To this day, no Ionian will ever publicly speak of what occurred.\n\nAfter the Noxian invasion was contained, Master Yi fell into a deep isolation.  For years, he trained morning to night, speaking to no one and refusing offers of consolation by fellow Ionians.  The only thing stopping him from madly charging into Noxus battle lines headfirst was his pledge to keep the Wuju style alive.  Even though he seethed with impatience, his rage became a tool for sharpening his practice of Wuju, developing stronger and deadlier skills for his eventual vengeance.  The only thing that roused him was news of the League's formation, and Noxus' subsequent enrollment in the League. Master Yi now brings his mastery of the blade to the League of Legends with unflinching purpose: to avenge his kinfolk and end the predations of the Noxus once and for all.\n\n''The art of Wuju lives on in Master Yi, and is plunged through the hearts of his foes.'' -- Soraka, the Starchild</Story>

  <Champion name="Miss Fortune" title="The Bounty Hunter" range="550" gender="f" rp="975" ip="4800" spotlight="vZh_hN-62YA" abilityVideoID="0021">
    <Story>For those who brave the harsh seas of Runeterra, attaining one's own ship and crew is the pinnacle of success. Sarah Fortune, a well-respected (some would say legendary) bounty hunter from Bilgewater, was able to achieve this feat just after her sixteenth birthday, etching out her name as the go-to gal for resolving special troubles. No bounty was too difficult or too dangerous for her feminine charm and her renowned use of her twin pistols, ''Shock and Awe''. Her success gave her the means to legitimately purchase her own ship... with a little flirtatious haggling, of course. Things weren't always so fortunate for Miss Fortune, though. When she was young, trade ships began to dot the horizon of her quiet home in the northern shores of Blue Flame Island's largest chunk. Trade routes brought piracy, and the inhabitants soon found themselves caught in a frenzy of pillage.\n\nOne day, young Sarah returned home to hear gunshots and screaming. Her front door was smashed open; inside, she saw her mother lying in a pool of blood. A sudden blow to her head made her collapse next to her slain mother. The last thing she could remember were her attacker's red eyes, as his face was blocked by a rogue's bandana. Miss Fortune has a strong distrust for pirates and she finds herself constantly bickering with the infamous Gangplank (the only captain to resist her charms) over the direction of Bilgewater politics. Her two goals: to unite the people of Bilgewater, making them into a strong and independent society, and to find the pirate who killed her mother. To that end, she has entered the League of Legends as a champion, trading her skills for the wealth and influence that will help her accomplish both.</Story>

    <Judgment date="31 August, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Miss Fortune spills into the Great Hallway with the same tenacity that she spills into her silk blouse, both taxed to contain her. She is cramped inside any structure not bobbing across the salt ocean. Her eyes pan across the recessed ceiling’s filigree with disdain, the toil of Valoran's finest artisans a pitiful substitute for the night sky’s celestial collage. The disapproving shake of her head would be imperceptible, if not exaggerated by the wag of her ornamented tricorne, the defining accessory of a captain. An avalanche of cherry locks tumbles from the hat, engulfing her shoulders in scarlet waves. Her every feature seduces attention, a weapon as – or perhaps more – potent than the enormous gilded muskets clinging to her hips.
        \n\n
        She bounds across the tiles. The impact of every footfall ripples up the curves of her figure; the distraction of her beauty magnified in motion. One can practically see the hearts of those who’ve beheld her trailing in her wake.
        \n\n
        An inscription looms overhead: The truest opponent lies within.
        \n\n
        The corner of her lips twitch, almost a smile. With uncanny grace, she plucks a musket from its holster, twirls it once round her finger and brings it to rest with the word "opponent" in its crosshair. Her lips mouth a silent pop, and the firearm is re-holstered. She dawdles no longer.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Hands on her hips, Miss Fortune tapped her foot impatiently in the dark. This was a juvenile tactic. If the League resorted to gimmicks like black smoke for its trials, perhaps she never should have made landfall. Her foot sank mid-thought. She intended to recoil, but a familiar sensation pressed her on all sides.
        \n\n
        She didn't hear herself cry, but she watched bubbles carry the sound away. Water? She flailed, her limbs searching for something solid. Yards above, she saw the surface’s dancing prism of light. She paddled furiously, but the light remained distant - something was wrong. More bubbles. The skin of her leg crawled, begging attention. Precious air waning, she risked a glance and found the problem. Rooted seaweed clutched her ankle tightly, apparently aware of its catch. She tore at it, but its slimy grip would not relent. Out of time, Sarah Fortune watched the last bubbles drift merrily upward, growing smaller and smaller, until salt stung her lungs. She felt strangely peaceful when her vision faded.
        \n\n
        I'm on my way, Mom.
        \n\n
        Sarah's sides wrenched in misery. A torrent poured from her mouth. Expecting entrails, she pried her eyes open. She grasped for focus; the escaping deluge lacked the visceral color she'd expected. Blurry vines framing her field of vision coalesced into defeated strands of hair, dangling limply around her face. Her hands dug into the sand. Her mind filled the gaps: she was kneeling on the beach and the puddle in front of her consisted of frothy seawater, as opposed to innards. Her lungs, battling her stomach, forced an inhale before the next heave.
        \n\n
        "A sure ugly sight ye be fer a young wench. Thought yeh might be shark bait fer a turn."
        \n\n
        A sputter of briny droplets was the best retort Sarah could articulate. Her eyes locked on the source, a garish boy, and she fell backward. His onyx hair and leering grin were unmistakable, but he was too young.
        \n\n
        "How..."
        \n\n
        "Ye be a lucky one. I was huntin’ fer mermaids. Fancy me letdown when I spied yer kickers."
        \n\n
        Her breath found rhythm. "They don't disappoint many."
        \n\n
        "They got some shape to be sure, but I seen better."
        \n\n
        Sarah stumbled to her feet, wet clothes matted to her body. "There are none better."
        \n\n
        The boy chortled. "So what be the reward fer fishin ye from the drink?"
        \n\n
        "Thanks?"
        \n\n
        "A fine thanks I’ll wager, but no reward I assure ye." He pointed at her head. “How bout ‘at?”
        \n\n
        She touched her hair, and her fingers grasped a smooth object. She extracted a pearlescent comb, fashioned from a conch. Mother’s comb? She examined it dubiously; an epiphany clawed at the back of her mind. She opened her mouth, but before she could speak, the boy closed the distance and stole a lingering kiss. Her nagging subconscious burst, realization surging forth. This beach, this boy...the day her mother died.
        \n\n
        She'd wandered from her house, drenched in her mother’s blood. Wading into the surf, she was vaguely aware of the crimson wisps stretching from her garments. She dipped below the surface and screamed, attempting to shock her mind back to rationality. Beneath the waves, her tears either joined or comprised the ocean around her, she couldn’t tell.
        \n\n
        That day, the boy was waiting on the banks. Under other circumstances, she’d have wondered how long he had been there; she may have even blushed. But she only stared, too exhausted to ponder his presence. His mouth moved, but her ears denied the sound. Then he joined her amongst the waves and kissed her, a confounding loop added to the dizzying course of her emotions.
        \n\n
        He pulled away with her mother’s comb in hand, cackling. One day he’d make a ruthless pirate. Prize in tow, he sauntered off, jack boots stamping the sand. He turned once, comb held high, and bellowed, “Come an’ get it!” He then laughed, disappearing beneath black sails which dotted the distant shoreline.
        \n\n
        Strangely inspired, Sarah welled with new found purpose. Once she'd buried her mother, and burned her house to the ground, she would enjoy getting her comb back.
        \n\n
        As the memory receded, Miss Fortune jerked away from the boy’s embrace.
        \n\n
        “Who are you?!”
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Miss Fortune?” The seadog timbre was gone.
        \n\n
        “What?”
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League?”
        \n\n
        “I...for power and plunder.” She doubted her own words.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League?” Frost bit every syllable.
        \n\n
        Crashing waves filled the silence.
        \n\n
        “I need to find him.”
        \n\n
        “How does it feel, exposing your mind?”
        \n\n
        Miss Fortune let his inquiry hang in the air. Drowned and drained, questions brimming, she felt somehow revitalized.
        \n\n
        “Thank you.”
        \n\n
        Light filled her view, and the hallway beckoned. The marble doors behind her offered retreat. She laughed at the thought. No matter what, Miss Fortune always gets her man.

  <Champion name="Mordekaiser" title="The Master of Metal" range="125" isManaless="true" gender="m" rp="975" ip="3150" abilityVideoID="0082">
    <Story>During the most recent winter solstice - when no other night during the year is longer - a being like no other emerged from the forgotten alleyways of Noxus. Standing eight feet tall, and concealed within a razor-sharp armored shell, he came to be known only as Mordekaiser. The nature of what lies beneath his metallic carapace is a popular subject of speculation. Many allege that he is a mortal man with a heart that has hardened to iron. Others insist that he is a dark specimen of the undead. But there are some who whisper warnings that he is merely a foreshadowing of something terrible and unprecedented yet to come. Despite the public conjecture and curiosity, none have discovered what lies beneath his alloyed exterior. What is known is this: Mordekaiser arrived unannounced at the Institute one day and, with a rasp that crept ice up the spines of all within earshot, requested to join the League of Legends.\n\nUpon glimpsing his fearful visage, most keep their distance, fortunately unaware that his touch bears a sinister scourge. Those who stumble within his grasp fall victim to incurable maladies. In fact, Mordeakiser seems mystically attuned to sickness, as if it feeds and comprises part of his chilling essence. He now stalks the slums of Noxus, drawn to the plague-ridden and diseased. However, there is something in his clever tactics, something in his noble stance, and something in the tone of his unearthly commands that has led many to believe that Mordekaiser is more than just a foot soldier. Some see the distinguishing characteristics of a general. While many have learned to accept the evidence of this unsettling possibility, a lingering questions keeps them wary at the witching hour: if Mordekaiser is a general, what nightmarish legion lurks at his command?\n\n''The common perception is that the encompassing armor protects him, I fear that - for the fragile time being - it actually protects us.'' - Rozuel Fecirem, Arch Adjudicator, noted in Mordekaiser's eligibility evaluation</Story>

    <Story>There is a world far away populated by graceful and beautiful winged beings gifted with immortality, where an ancient conflict still rages. Like so many conflicts, this war split families. One side proclaimed themselves as beings of perfect order and justice, fighting to unite the world under their law and strong central governance. Those that fought against them saw their kin as tyrants, creatures incapable of seeing the larger view, who would sacrifice individuality and freedom for the illusion of efficiency and safety. Morgana was one who fought against what she perceived as the tyranny of her kind, and for that she was branded ''fallen.'' Morgana was not innocent, having plumbed forgotten ways to gather forbidden might to become a powerful mistress of the black arts. This goal was driven by her obsession to defeat the general of the opposition's army - her sister, Kayle.\n\nWhile the two were in fact birth-sisters, Kayle struck the first blow by disowning any filial connection when Morgana refused to join her cause. Eventually, Morgana grew in power enough to not only reach, but challenge Kayle. As the time approached when the two would meet in what could be their final conflict, Morgana was suddenly summoned to Valoran. At first, Morgana made a deal with the League's summoners to fight in exchange for greater power. With the advent of Kayle into the League, Morgana now willingly fights in the League of Legends for the privilege of being able to destroy her sister again, and again, and again. She lies in wait for the day the bonds of the Institute of War no longer hold her, and on that day she plans to destroy Kayle once and for all and return home a hero.\n\n''There is no rest while Kayle's brand of tyranny still exists.''\n-Morgana</Story>

  <Champion name="Nasus" title="The Curator of The Sands" range="125" gender="m" rp="585" ip="1350" abilityVideoID="0075">
    <Story>The enigmatic creature known as Nasus came to the League from a faraway world, and served as part of a vast and learned desert empire. There he was a respected and enlightened individual, having been made the Keeper of the Great Library. However, he was also part of a race of animalistic creatures that served as the rulers and protectors of the people. Unfortunately, there were others of his kind that believed they were more than protectors. They were under the egotistical delusion that they had ascended to become gods. War on Nasus's world was never more than a breath away, as these deluded others sought to enslave the people and establish a totalitarian sovereignty. In the midst of a heated battle, just as Nasus was about to slay his treacherous brother Renekton, he was pulled through the cosmos to a summoning circle in Runeterra.\n\nAt first angered that he had been taken just as he was about to cripple the enemies of his people, Nasus' advanced intellect won out when he heard the pleas of mercy from the summoners. He learned that Runeterra was also filled with its own brand of injustice. This danger was no less threatening than what he had fought against at home, and champions were needed to protect the people of this world. Heeding the call, Nasus chose to take his place in the League of Legends, knowing that his brothers and sisters would carry on the fight back home. These days, he is the Curator of the Sands, feeling most at home in the crumbling ruins of the Shurima Desert. However, recent disturbing news has reached the Keeper's ears - rumors that perhaps his brother had not in fact been left behind. If this were the case, the destruction of Renekton would quickly become Nasus' main priority, before this world too faces the threads of his brother's forked-tongue and endless ambition.\n\nThe Curator of the Sands, though contemplative, is not to be trifled with.</Story>

    <Story>
      Once, Nautilus was a sailor commissioned by the Institute of War to explore the uncharted reaches of the Guardian’s Sea. This expedition took him deep into unknown waters where he and his crew found a vast section of the ocean’s rich blue waves were replaced by a black, oozing liquid that none of the crew could identify. Though their job was to investigate anything new that they found, no man aboard was willing to brave the murk except Nautilus. Only moments after he donned the hulking diver’s suit and climbed over the ship’s rail, something lurking in the muck grabbed hold of him. He clung to the side of the ship, but the thing below pulled him fiercely, rocking the entire ship. The other sailors grew afraid and made a terrible decision. As he stared and pled for help, they wrenched his grip free of the rail. He tumbled to the ink, grabbing the anchor in futile desperation. As he sank, he could do nothing but watch as the dark outline of his ship faded away. Then everything went black.
      \n\n
      When Nautilus awoke, he was something different. The great iron suit was now somehow part of him, he could not tell where it ended and he began. All the details of his memory were fuzzy and indistinct but one fact remained clear: he was left here, alone in the sunless depths, to die. In his hands he still clutched the anchor that belonged to the men who had condemned him. Having no other purpose, he took this clue and trudged - too heavy to swim or run - in search of answers. He wandered without direction or sense of passing time in what felt like an eternal dream. By the time he stumbled upon the shores of Bilgewater, he could find no traces of the man he was. No house, no family, no life to which he could return. Terrified sailors who’d heard his tale directed Nautilus back to the Institute, but the summoners refused to relinquish the names of the others they commissioned. By then Nautilus had learned about the League of Legends and there he saw an opportunity to discover and punish those responsible for the time and life he lost.

  <Champion name="Nidalee" title="The Bestial Huntress" range="525" gender="m" rp="975" ip="3150" abilityVideoID="0076">
    <Story>There are few dwellers, let alone champions, residing in the blasted and dangerous lands that lie south of the Great Barrier. Much of that world still bears the scars of past Runes Wars, especially the mysterious Kumungu Jungle. There are long-forgotten treasures in these strange places which many risk life and limb to acquire. The champion known as Nidalee was only a young girl travelling with her treasure-seeking parents when they lost their way in the dense, rainy jungles. The jungle was unforgiving, and she watched her parents suffer agonizing final days as they fell victim to a mysterious and vicious disease.\n\nAs improbable as it was for a child to survive in the inhospitable jungle by herself, she did just that. Her youthful innocence and a fortunate naivete caused her to appeal to the beasts of that place and she was taken in by a family of cougars and raised as one of their own. She grew and somehow absorbed the raw magic of the dense wilds, evolving beyond both her human physiology and her feline affectation. On one pivotal day in her life, standing over the torn remnants of a Noxian squad of woodcutters, Nidalee chose to rejoin the so-called civilized world, to fight in the League of Legends so as to protect the vast woods from both Demacia and Noxus.\n\nNidalee was taught to fight by her feline family, battling viciously with tooth and nail. Something in her feline ways may draw you to her, but remember that she is no pussycat.</Story>

  <Champion name="Nocturne" title="The Eternal Nightmare" range="125" gender="m" rp="975" ip="6300" spotlight="owrwt97AH54" abilityVideoID="0056">
    <Story>Before Nocturne, people believed that dreams were figments of their imagination, meaningless images that flashed through the mind when one slept. This belief was put to the test when a rash of sleep-related incidents started afflicting summoners of the League. Some would wake up screaming, terrified and beyond consolation. Some could not fall asleep, slowly going mad as the nights ticked by. Some simply never woke up. Physicians were baffled until a Field Architect happened to pass out next to a nexus on Twisted Treeline. Witnesses said he cried out once and then stopped breathing. Immediately after, magical energy arced out from the nexus, and Nocturne appeared.\n\nNocturne did not take his introduction to this world kindly. He slaughtered everything he could find before summoners were able to magically confine him. After a period of intense study, League experts divined that Nocturne hunted summoners in their sleep, attacking them in a place where their magic was useless. This seemed to be his only purpose. The families of the victims demanded justice, but League officials were concerned that death might only return Nocturne to the place from which he came. They bound him to a nexus fragment, trapping him in the physical world. As punishment for his crimes, they allowed summoners to call upon Nocturne in the League matches, bending his will to the summoners he hates and creating his own personal nightmare. League scholars don't know whether he truly came from the plane of dreams, or whether there are any more like him. Some theorize that the summoning act affected summoners' subconscious minds, luring Nocturne to them in their sleep. Perhaps the most disturbing theory is that Nocturne is a person's nightmare come to life. If this is true, they wonder, who is the dreamer?\n\n''The darkness is closing in...it's pitch black now...but I can still see him...''\n- Kelvin Ma, patient #4236</Story>

    <Judgment date="11 March, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        The Field Architect has had a long day. Surveying the grounds for signs of degradation is no small task; taking readings every five feet is essential in order to detect even the slightest disturbances in the intricate energy fields. An overlooked spike in the surrounding forces could set off a chain reaction of destruction due to the rampant use of magic on the Fields of Justice. In his own little way, he liked to think that he was saving Runeterra one checkpoint at a time.
        \n\n
        His work complete, the architect makes his way back to the summoning platform, where he passes a nexus that should have been dormant. An unbidden spark inside the nexus catches his eye. He turns to investigate only to be struck by a wild burst of energy arcing out of the nexus. The architect collapses to the floor in a heap, sprawling on the unforgiving cobblestone.
        \n\n
        His body shrivels as a noxious trail of thick smoke pours out of his open mouth. It is shivering with life and pulsing with horrors.
        \n\n
        It is born of nightmares.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Nocturne had drifted through the minds of humans for endless expanses of time. He beheld the faces they yearned for, absorbed the desires that coursed through their veins, and inhabited the fantasies that set their hearts ablaze. He lingered within the despicably human illusions they conjured in the narrow expanse that was their puny brains.
        \n\n
        From all of them, he consumed the magic that rippled through their souls.
        \n\n
        Nocturne had only a moment to examine his new found physical form before a circle of robed summoners appeared around him. He knew who they were before they even revealed themselves. These were the overlords whose faces consumed each mind of every summoner whose dreams he haunted. They were the voices that drenched lesser kinds with promises of great power, and they were the hands that directed the ebb and flow of the entire world. Nocturne knew what these humans wanted, but they would not get him.
        \n\n
        His shadowed form ghosted silently toward one of the humans, reaching out with the ethereal tendrils of his consciousness. The cloaked human spasmed as his hands rose to tear at his own head. A bloodcurdling scream ripped through the air, then choked off into silence as the human's mind collapsed into itself.
        \n\n
        The other humans barely had a chance to react before Nocturne was on them. He reached out with his limbs as twin blades extended forth from his arms to rend human flesh from bone. The shadow darted low and slashed upwards with his blades, impaling an unfortunate summoner through the entire length of his body.
        \n\n
        Nocturne felt a group of humans rush up from behind; for a second, his form pulsed. Darkness smothered the entire field, an oppressive blackness that breathed and sighed. Victims eternally trapped in the phantasm murmured in the summoners' ears, promising eternal torment and pleading for release. Disembodied hands clawed at the living, desperate to rip any semblance of existence away for their own keeping.
        \n\n
        The remaining summoners lashed out, flailing against the ghastly fingers that only disappeared long enough to reappear again in greater numbers. Spell incantations decayed on their lips as the magical energies refused to heed their call. The darkness began to suffocate the humans, and they clawed at their eyes in a wild attempt to regain their sight. Devoured by terror, they didn't even sense Nocturne's approach, nor did they feel the blades that cleaved through their soft bodies and condemned their souls to an eternity in the darkness.
        \n\n
        One summoner had stood apart from the others. He was decorated with gold chains draped over purple robes. Unaffected by the blindness and horrors, he had chosen to observe impassively as the carnage unfurled. No expression flickered over his face as the pooled blood stained the hem of his robes, nor did his visage change when the dismembered head of his former comrade bumped up against his leg.
        \n\n
        The summoner spoke. "Impressive. I see that the eons you've spent leeching off of our minds have managed to serve some purpose."
        \n\n
        "I know who you are." Nocturne returned.
        \n\n
        "I'm flattered." The summoner sneered. "Then you should also know that it is time you repay us for the horrors you have wrought upon our kind."
        \n\n
        "And how do you plan to do that, human?" A monstrous howl echoed from the shadows, something akin to what those humans called a laugh.
        \n\n
        "You are now in the world of our control. And you shall be in our service."
        \n\n
        "You call this pitiful existence 'payment'?" A flick of Nocturne's hideous blade sent a pile of steaming entrails splattering across the ground. He readied the jagged edge for this last foolish one. "You may have conjured me into your world somehow, but all you will receive is destruction."
        \n\n
        With a roar, Nocturne heaved himself at the summoner. His blood-soaked blade came within a razor's width of carving that aggravating smirk off the human's face. Metal circled around his wrists, clanging shut, and sent him flying backwards into a heap of metal chains.
        \n\n
        "No. This is your reparation." The summoner's lips parted, wet with anticipation. "Welcome to the League."
        \n\n
        The summoners whose bodies lay in a pile around him raised their heads. Their arms shot out and clamped onto Nocturne with an iron grip. They dragged him downward, forcing his physical existence into submission. Every part of him screamed out against the shackles as he involuntarily bowed to the towering head summoner. Nocturne was now in service to the League, and it was his own eternal nightmare.

    <Story>Freljord is an unforgiving land covered in snow and ice. Travel, especially in the winter, can be very dangerous. The elements often claim even those who have spent their entire lives there. The boy known as Nunu is defined by such tragedy. One day when he was a young child, Nunu rode on his father's back as they returned from a trapping expedition in the mountains. An unexpected blizzard came upon them, forcing them to seek refuge in a cave. The tempest was the worst in countless years, and it lasted for days. Nunu's father left to find food, but he never returned.\n\nThe blizzard eventually cleared, and the young child lay dying on the mountainside. Fortunately for Nunu, this was the land of the yetis, who are powerful beasts with whom Nunu's father had secured and arrangement for safe passage. A young yeti boy named Willump found Nunu and brought him home. From then on Nunu was raised by the yetis, whose culture remains a mystery to most Runeterrans. The boy quickly discovered that the seemingly savage creatures were in fact deeply spiritual beings living in harmony with their environment. They are very territorial and unafraid of defending themselves if called upon to do so. The yetis have watched the rest of Valoran, and they can smell the change on the wind. When the League of Legends was formed, the yetis knew they needed a champion. Riding his brother Willump, Nunu became that champion. Those who follow the League know that the boy is mature beyond his years, but, while he appears human, his mind is that of his adoptive kin.\n\nIf this is him now, imagine what Nunu will be like when he grows up!</Story>

  <Champion name="Olaf" title="The Berserker" range="125" gender="m" rp="975" ip="3150" spotlight="YuC3ZUY88d8" abilityVideoID="0001">
    <Story>On an uncharted continent beyond Valoran's grasping clutches, the conqueror named Olaf was born to a long tradition of soldiers unlike most others.  Berserkers, as they tout themselves, are warriors who channel fury deep from their cores, unleashing pure and savage wrath upon their enemies.  This fearsome evolution is a product of their unforgiving home, Lokfar - a barren tundra where all creatures must vie bitterly for every resource.  Olaf belonged to a seafaring clan known for ruthlessly pillaging any and all villages within reach of their dragon-crested longboats.  The last time he saw his icy home, Olaf was embarking on an expedition to pioneer and plunder a distant land known only to legend.  However, while underway, a terrible storm sprung up and Olaf and his crew were thrown to the mercy of a roiling and pitiless sea.\n\nHis ship destroyed, his crew nowhere to be found, Olaf miraculously washed up untold miles from ''friendly'' waters on the foreign shores of Valoran, south of Demacia.  This unfamiliar place stunned and frightened the Berserker, for Lokfar is not privy to such potent magicians.  Approaching them, Olaf hoped that they could use their mysterious powers to send him back to his people.  A bargain was struck.  Olaf would use his awesome prowess as a warrior to serve the unusual wars of Valoran in the League of Legends, and in exchange the sorcerers would find him a way to return.  Despite his participation in the League, Olaf knows better than to trust the ''finger wagglers'' that run the Institute of War.  He deliberately keeps details of his life and home from them.  After all, with enough information, they would most certainly find the Lokfarians and dominate them as they have dominated all of Valoran, keeping both quietly -- and unwittingly -- in their thrall.\n\nBeware the war cry of the Berserker.  What surges toward you is unyielding, free from the shackles of reason.</Story>

  <Champion name="Orianna" title="The Lady of Clockwork"  range="525" gender="f" rp="975" ip="4800" spotlight="EUpTRoSQEX4" abilityVideoID="0061">
    <Story>There once was a Piltovian man named Corin Reveck who had a daughter named Orianna, whom he loved more than anything else in the world. Though Orianna had incredible talent for dancing, she was deeply fascinated by the champions of the League of Legends. This fascination compelled her to begin training to become such a champion. It is unfortunate that her sheltered, wide-eyed naivete led her to take unnecessary and dangerous chances which ultimately led to her tragic demise. Orianna's death shattered Corin, driving him into deep depression and an obsession with techmaturgy. He could not stand the void his daughter's death left in his life, so he decided to build a replacement - one that would complete Orianna's dream of joining the League. What was created is the clockwork killing machine that Corin named after his daughter. Knowing that she was destined to be a champion and seeing the way the times were changing, he created The Ball as her pet and protector. This nearly symbiotic creation uses a different type of techmaturgy, relying more heavily on electricity than clockwork.\n\nOrianna and The Ball now fight as Champions in the League of Legends, using her sometimes misguided morality as a compass. She tries in earnest to fit in with those around her.  However, no matter how hard she tries, Orianna can never be human and there is always something unnerving and alien about her. Though she attempts social interaction with other champions in the League of Legends, there are few who can get past her exotic nature. To many, it's as if there's nothing inside, that Orianna is just a soulless clockwork shell - a dangerous and deadly one at that. However, all along she remains the perfect daughter in her father's eyes.\n\n''Dance with me, my pet. Dance with me into oblivion.''</Story>

    <Judgment date="31 May, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        The workshop is a disaster. Parts lay haphazardly among the fabrication equipment. Mystical substances and materials are strewn everywhere. Plates of half-eaten food grow mold in the corners.
        \n\n
        If there were mirrors, Corin would probably be frightened by his own reflection. Disheveled, wild-eyed, and manic, he puts what appear to be the finishing touches on his creation. It is beautiful and intricate, a facsimile of a girl in elegant clockwork.
        \n\n
        All that remains is to give it life. However, the enchantment of an Infinity Gear is purely theoretical. Corin is the first to come this close to making it a reality. He gently removes the Gear from the catalyst fluid. It pulses with energy. He smiles a too-wide smile as he places it inside of his creation. The reaction is immediate.
        \n\n
        The gears inside the clockwork girl begin to turn, slowly at first. His creation begins to jerk, as life floods to every end of every limb. It is like watching a death spasm in reverse.
        \n\n
        Corin clutches a picture of a pretty young girl to his chest as he watches, tears in his eyes.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The clockwork girl was not the first created being to have entered the halls of the Institute of War. The Great Steam Golem had done so years before. However, there was something noble about Blitzcrank, something alive in the way he moved and expressed himself.
        \n\n
        This thing seemed dead inside. It seemed like an automaton, trying to act like as if it was alive. The effect was unsettling.
        \n\n
        Senior Summoner Montrose appraised the thing that had introduced itself as Orianna. She reached behind her back, unnaturally flexible, and wound the giant key in her back. It's not that she didn't have facial expressions – they were just wrong. There was something in everything she did that was just a little bit off, off enough to be just this side of completely alien.
        \n\n
        Then there was The Ball. One might assume that it was her pet, but the relationship was deeper than that. It was as if the two were symbiotically linked. The Ball was just that – a floating ball, equal parts clockwork and some kind of electrical techmaturgy. From time to time, a strange eye on a stalk would emerge from within the sphere, examining the surroundings.
        \n\n
        "I wish to be a champion. It will be fun," said Orianna, in a voice that was some approximation of human.
        \n\n
        Summoner Carin looked at Senior Summoner Montrose. "Is this even going to work?"
        \n\n
        Orianna's body turned, while her head stayed riveted on them. "Of course it will work. I will be a good champion."
        \n\n
        Montrose responded. "Orianna, in order to admit you into the League of Legends, we must explore your mind. We are wondering if you have the kind of mind we can explore."
        \n\n
        Back in the right orientation, the clockwork girl's skirt began to tick. "My father says yes. I have a mind. Do so. If The Ball is okay with it." The Ball chimes and clicks, but makes no hostile move.
        \n\n
        There was a rush of what felt like wind, and then darkness, and then light. There was a young girl dressed like a ballerina. She danced in front of an audience. She was quite gifted. However, this memory was muted, disconnected emotionally.
        \n\n
        Colors blur. The Institute of War comes back into focus.
        \n\n
        "Orianna, are those your memories?" asked Senior Summoner Montrose.
        \n\n
        The clockwork girl laughed. It wasn't playful. It was cold and mechanical. "Those are Orianna's memories. I am Orianna. My father says so."
        \n\n
        The younger summoner looked to Montrose for his cue. His composure unshaken, he nodded his head. "Then we'll try again."
        \n\n
        Shadows, lights, colors. Someone had constructed what appeared to be a lane from Summoner's Rift. The young girl was much older now, and quite agile. She seemed to be training as a champion. There was a tower and it appeared to be fully armed.
        \n\n
        The one-eyed trainer coaxed her on with a gruff voice. "Come on, Orianna. Time to learn how to tower dive. I've goosed the power down, but it'll hurt if you get hit."
        \n\n
        The girl smiled naïvely. She readied herself, the picture of agility and poise. She began the run as the tower fired bolts at her. It was immediately clear that something was wrong. The blasts from the tower did not seem benign, as they chewed up the ground around her. Her natural grace kept her one step ahead, for the moment, as they began to come more and more frequently. The trainer mashed his controls, trying desperately to turn it off, yelling at her the whole time. However, Orianna was too engrossed in her exercise to notice.
        \n\n
        The first blast took her off her feet, knocking her into the ground. Winded, she attempted to get up. The second blast wasn't far behind. She tried weakly to get up, blood trickling from the corners of her mouth. After the third, she didn't get up.
        \n\n
        Colors blur. The Institute of War came back into focus.
        \n\n
        "Yes, I died," offered Orianna.
        \n\n
        Carin, ever the one for formality, replied. "We have entered your mind, Orianna. How did this make you feel?"
        \n\n
        The clockwork girl giggled in an inhuman way. "It was fun. I like memories. Don't you?"
        \n\n
        Senior Summoner Montrose cleared his throat. "Why do you want to be a part of the League of Legends?"
        \n\n
        "Because it is what I have always wanted. Because my father designed me to do so. Because The Ball is impatient to play on the Fields of Justice." As if in answer, she turned to pet The Ball, which began to crackle with energy.
        \n\n
        Montrose continued. "And you understand the conditions of such admission?"
        \n\n
        "Yes," replied Orianna. "I will play by the rules of your Institute. I will be a good girl."
        \n\n
        The Ball whirred and clicked. Orianna added, "And The Ball will, too. Be a good ball, that is."
        \n\n
        Clearly uneasy by the experience, Summoner Carin remained silent. Senior Summoner Montrose, however unsettled himself, maintained his air of authority. "Then you shall be a Champion, clockwork girl. The arrangements will be made."
        \n\n
        Orianna made a sound that supposed to a girl's squeal of glee and hugged The Ball. While it might have been touching, it was unfortunately only horrifying.

    <Story>Far above the clouds on Mount Targon resides a stalwart tribe of people known as the Rakkor who still revere combat and war as ultimate artforms. They remember the Rune Wars of Runeterra and know that the League of Legends can only repress the rising tides of violence for so long. Each member of the tribe is bred to be a disciplined and vicious warrior, preferring to battle soldiers of either the Noxian or Demacian armies only when outnumbered at least ten to one. Rakkor warriors are trained not only to be as lethal with their bare hands as the most capable martial artists, but also to fiercely wield the many relic-weapons of the tribe. Such treasures have been handed down from generation to generation, and have harnessed the mystical nature of Runeterra in their very cores.  These relic-weapons are among the most dangerous in existence - and it comes as no surprise that they have found their way to the League of Legends in the hands of Pantheon.\n\nThis stone-faced warrior is a paragon of his people, his very existence an anthem of exultation to the art of combat. Pantheon found it insulting that the people of Valoran would install an organization to replace war, complete with so-called champions, without including the Rakkor. Gathering the blessings of his tribe and armed with the relics of his ancestors, he has descended on the League to show the world a true warrior. He cares not who he fights, and cares nothing for the pageantry or prestige of a League champion, but lives only for the austere glory of battle.  As long as Pantheon breathes, he thirsts for another foe to vanquish.\n\n''I was hoping they had more reinforcements.'' - Pantheon, standing amidst the pieces of a brutalized Noxian battalion.</Story>

    <Story>While other young yordle girls played skip-step and braided wreathes out of posies, Poppy spent her youth earning calluses and grease stains in her father's armor shop.  Blomgrun, her father, was Bandle City's finest smith.  The only thing he loved as much as his work was his young daughter, Poppy - named for the sprightly sounds of the sparks that leapt from his ever-burning forge.  He welled with pride the day she was first able to lift his trusty hammer, Whomper.  Poppy immediately took to his art, demonstrating a natural gift for smithing, which Blomgrun honed with devoted instruction.\n\nOne day, a Demacian general named Florin Berell commissioned Blomgrun to craft a helm, glorious beyond comparison.  Blomgrun toiled away on this project, determined to present Florin with his finest work.  He let Poppy set the center jewel, entrusting her with the most important piece.  When the pair finished, they departed for Demacia to deliver it in person.  Word of the general's order, however, was leaked to the Noxian High Command, and two Noxian assassins were dispatched to intercept the delivery.  Blomgrun was able to occupy the assassins long enough for Poppy to escape with the prized helm.  She watched helplessly from the brush as her father was slain.  Instead of fleeing home, she carried the helm the rest of the way to Demacia alone.  She refused payment for it, saying that no amount would compensate for her father's life.  Instead, she offered it as a gift, honoring her father's final intentions.  Florin saw the grim determination behind the tears in her eyes, and requested that the leadership of Bandle City appoint Poppy as the yordle ambassador to Demacia.  Soon after, seeking to crush Noxus with her father's hammer, Poppy volunteered for the League of Legends.\n\nPoppy may be small, but Whomper - or her will - is not.</Story>

    <Story>Ravaged by Rune Wars long past, the lands south of the Great Barrier are wrecked by chaotic magical storms, leaving the grasp of nature's rule tenuous at best. While abnormal flora or fauna are the norm rather than the exception in these ruined areas, perhaps none is more curious than the case of Rammus. While no one is entirely certain why an armadillo from the Shurima Desert crossed the Kumungu Jungle into the Plague Jungles, Rammus made just such a journey. There, amongst the twisted vines and festering rot, he came across an oddity - a healthy evergreen hedge maze, stretching as far as the eye could see. As he explored the maze, something compelled him toward its center - a light, a presence of some kind. As he drew closer, the light surged, blinding him and knocking him unconscious.\n\nWhen he awoke, Rammus' whole world had changed. The maze had vanished and he felt truly cognizant for the first time in his otherwise unremarkable life. As his predicament dawned on him, Rammus had a moment of panic. As he trembled, the earth around him began to shake, the intensity increasing until he managed to steady himself. As the quake receded, Rammus arose and left the Plague Jungles in search of others like him.  His search brought him across all the lands south of the Great Barrier, but everywhere he went, he was unique.The hardships of this sojourn inspired him to craft the suit of armor that would earn him the title of Armordillo. Rammus' quest eventually drew him to the only place where a sentient armadillo is less than confounding - the League of Legends.\n\n''I've seen a lot of things, but this... this is a first.'' - Ezreal, the Prodigal Explorer, after first meeting Rammus </Story>

    <Story>On a faraway world, Renekton was born a member of a race of bestial guardians created to serve as the rulers and protectors of their people. Alongside his brother Nasus, Renekton oversaw the upkeep of the Great Library, which served as both a vault of ancient knowledge and the repository of the teachings of the Cycle of Life and Death. While the enlightened Nasus taught those scholars who came to study, Renekton served as the Great Library's gatekeeper. He could sense the true natures of those who sought Nasus' teachings, and he sent away those with dark ambitions. Over time, however, his repeated exposure to this evil infected his mind. He grew furious with the malevolence in the hearts of men, and as he descended deeper into madness, he discovered he could quell the fury by cutting the evil from the men who possessed it. Unfortunately, the relief was as short-lived as the subjects, and the ''butcher's rage'', as it came to be known, would resurge even stronger.\n\nConsumed by his anger, Renekton turned on the one being who could defeat him -- his own brother. Nasus pleaded with Renekton to see reason. Realizing that he was beyond redemption, the despondent Nasus valiantly struck down his wayward sibling. Defenseless, Renekton waited eagerly for death's release. It never came. He was spared when summoners from the League of Legends claimed his brother. Caught in the wake of this powerful spell, Renekton tumbled for what seemed like ages between realities. When he finally emerged, he fell deep into the sewers of Zaun. Insane with fury, Renekton languished in his newfound home, driven senseless by his rage. That is until, by happenstance, he caught a familiar scent in the air. Believing that the familiar scent would guide him to the solace that was fading from his memory, he traced his brother to the Institute of War.\n\n''My brother has become hollow. Full of rage, but empty.'' -- Nasus, the Curator of the Sands.</Story>

    <Judgment date="14 January, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        The bestial creature charges into the hallway, his head turning erratically from side to side as he seeks his target. The scent that he has been relentlessly trailing all the way from Zaun has brought him to the Institute of War. The unmistakable musk saturates the Great Hall.
        \n\n
        Erupting with fury, Renekton drops down to all fours, sending his enormous weapon crashing to the marble floor. He darts around the room to trace the origin of the scent. There is a frightening madness in his gaze, and his every movement is explosive. Suddenly, he straightens up, snatching up his blade in a single movement, and charges recklessly into double doors framed by a stone archway. The creature does not reach out to part the doors; they simply burst open from the sudden impact of his entire body. Renekton doesn't lose his stride - not with the promise of his prey so unbearably close.
        \n\n
        The prey is none other than his brother, Nasus.
        \n\n
        What the creature does not know is that the unrefusable summons that took away his brother was actually meant to target Renekton.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Renekton stumbles as a wave of vertigo washes over him. The floor drops out under his feet, and after a sickening moment of freefall, he finds himself back on solid ground. The creature rapidly blinks his eyes to clear a filmy haze that swirls around him. Taking a hesitant step forward, he emerges out of a pillar of light and finds himself on a raised stone platform overlooking an unfamiliar forest. The smells of trees, burning torches, and magic tinge the air. He surveys his surroundings, clearly puzzled by how he came to be there. The sounds of struggle can be heard far off in the distance.
        \n\n
        Suddenly, his brother's unmistakable scent drifts near and curls around his nostrils. Renekton instinctively launches himself forward, his legs pumping wildly down an open path leading into the forest. His elongated jaw hangs open, exposing rows of wicked looking teeth dripping with anticipation. The blood boils in his veins, bulging through his skin in spidery patterns that run up and down his massive arms.
        \n\n
        The creature turns the corner to find Nasus towering over a pool of ineffectual minions. Clad in shining gold armor, his brother expertly spins a staff over his head, unleashing a spirit flame towards the minions. The ground erupts with energy, the magic radiating in a brilliant shimmer as it consumes the small creatures.
        \n\n
        But Renekton sees none of that. All he sees is his reckoning.
        \n\n
        Renekton springs at Nasus, mowing down the minions who have the misfortune of being in his way. The sudden appearance of his long lost brother barely registers in Nasus’ mind before the enormous curved blade comes whistling through the air, aimed squarely at his neck. Nasus narrowly manages to dodge the attack, disappearing in a flash of light and re-emerging a safe distance away.
        \n\n
        "Brother?!
        \n\n
        Renekton charges forward, slashing wildly with the giant blade. Nasus deflects the blows with his staff, slowly being knocked back with every attack.
        \n\n
        "Brother, stop! What are you doing here?"
        \n\n
        A grin snakes down the length of Renekton's face. "Carnage!"
        \n\n
        Renekton crouches for a split second, and then leaps upward with blinding speed. Spinning in mid-air, he slashes his curved blade in a vicious arc. This time, the blade connects with flesh. Nasus's body falls to the ground, and Renekton stands over him, savoring the final moments before he destroys his brother.
        \n\n
        In a beam of light, his brother's body vanishes.
        \n\n
        Renekton frantically tears at the ground where his brother's body had just been, his claws ripping the dirt path. He twists around furiously, but the forest around him is deserted. A guttural roar erupts from the depths of his being.
        \n\n
        The creature catches his brother’s scent again and takes off in a dead sprint down the open path. In the distance, he sees Nasus appear on a platform similar to the one that had brought him here. A growl rumbles from his throat as he charges forward. Three defenders appear suddenly at the base of an intimidating tower at the top of the steps, outfitted with wicked weapons and grim expressions.
        \n\n
        Renekton bowls through them, his blade deflecting bullets fired at point blank by a buxom redhead. A bulky minotaur slams the ground and a curiously large armadillo drops down on all fours to defend against the attack, but they are no match for the crocodile in bloodlust. The defenders are knocked aside in Renekton's mad dash for Nasus.
        \n\n
        The creature charges up the steps, flying onto the platform with enormous momentum. Nasus reaches out to hold up his palm, as if to stop his brother, when suddenly a bright ray of light shoots out, engulfing him in an agonizing fire.
        \n\n
        Renekton immediately succumbs to the darkness.
        \n\n
        The creature awakens in a dark room, sprawled on a frigid stone floor. A group of cloaked magicians stand with their hands outstretched in a circle around him. They murmur strange words under their breath, ensnaring him in a glowing net of magic.
        \n\n
        When Renekton's vision clears, he sees his brother staring dispassionately at him from across the room. Renekton snarls, throwing himself bodily towards Nasus, but the magical chains that bind him hold firm. Nasus gazes back for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then he turns and steps into a lighted platform.
        \n\n
        Before he disappears, Nasus speaks. "It seems that the time to settle our conflict is yet to be determined. Goodbye, brother."
        \n\n
        Throwing his head back, Renekton lets loose a roar that shakes the foundations of the room. The violent rage caused by being so close to his brother and utterly unable to destroy him consumes him.
        \n\n
        The summoners standing around the creature don't ask the standard questions. The League finally has its chosen brother.

    <Story>
      On every wall of his den, the trophy hunter Rengar mounts the heads, horns, claws, and fangs of the most lethal creatures in Valoran. Though his collection is extensive, he remains unsatisfied, tirelessly seeking greater game. He takes time with every kill, studying his prey, learning, and preparing himself for the next encounter with the one monster he never managed to defeat.
      \n\n
      Rengar never knew his real parents, but was raised by a human who was revered as a legendary hunter. He was an ideal pupil, intently absorbing the lessons of his father, and improving them with his uncanny feral instincts. Before his mane had fully grown, Rengar set off on his own and claimed a wide territory for himself. Along its perimeter, he mounted the skulls of his slain prey - a warning to would-be aggressors. He thought undisputed reign of a region would fulfill him, but instead, he grew restless. No beasts in his domain proved challenging prey, and without formidable adversaries to push his limits, Rengar's spirit waned. He feared that no worthwhile game remained, that he would never again feel the thrill of the hunt. Just when things seemed their bleakest, he encountered the monster. It was a disturbing, alien thing, distinctly out of place in his world. It bore huge scything claws and devoured any animal that strayed across its path. Overzealous at the prospect of a challenge, Rengar ambushed the monster in haste. It far outclassed anything he'd hunted before. Their fight was savage, and each suffered crippling wounds. Rengar lost an eye, but the most grievous blow was to his pride. He had never before failed to make the kill. Worse yet, the severity of his injuries forced him to retreat. Over the following days, he hovered on the threshold between life and death. He was wracked with pain, but beneath it, he felt a glimmer of joy. The hunt was on. If such powerful beings existed in the world, he would find them, and stack their heads high. The monster, however, was a kill he wanted to savor. On his den's largest wall, he reserves a space for the beast's head, a trophy he swears will one day be the centerpiece of his collection.

    <Story>In Noxus, any citizen may rise to power regardless of race, gender, or social standing – strength is all that matters. It was with committed faith in this ideal that Riven strove to greatness. She showed early potential as a soldier, forcing herself to master the weight of a long sword when she was barely its height. She was ruthless and efficient as a warrior, but her true strength lay in her conviction. She entered battles without any trace of doubt in her mind: no ethical pause, no fear of death. Riven became a leader amongst her peers, poster child of the Noxian spirit. So exceptional was her passion that the High Command recognized her with a black stone rune sword forged and enchanted with Noxian sorcery. The weapon was heavier than a kite shield and nearly as broad – perfectly suited to her tastes. Soon after, she was deployed to Ionia as part of the Noxian invasion.\n\nWhat began as war quickly became extermination. Noxian soldiers followed the terrifying Zaunite war machines across fields of death. It wasn’t the glorious combat for which Riven trained. She carried out the orders of her superiors, terminating the remnants of a beaten and fractured enemy with extreme prejudice. As the invasion continued, it became clear that the Ionian society would not be reformed, merely eliminated. During one bitter engagement, Riven’s unit became surrounded by Ionian forces. They called for support as the enemy closed in around them. What they received instead was a barrage of biochemical terror launched by Singed. Riven watched as around her Ionian and Noxian alike fell victim to an unspeakably gruesome fate. She managed to escape the bombardment, though she could not erase the memory. Counted dead by Noxus, she saw an opportunity to start anew. She shattered her sword – severing ties with the past – and wandered in self-imposed exile. Now she seeks atonement and her own way to serve the pure Noxian vision in which she believed.\n\n“There is a place between war and murder / in which our demons lurk.” \n- Excerpted from the poem, “Scarlet Shon-Xan”</Story>

    <Judgment date="9 September, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        The weight Riven carries seems to hang in the air around her. The remnants of her Noxian armor are tarnished, they speak of her absence from duty. The broken sword she carries is, in itself, so massive that imagination falters to conceive of the blade’s original size.
        \n\n
        The echo of battle lingers with her. It smolders in her eyes, tenses in her grip, and coils in her step. It never leaves her. She is there now still, in the midst of it, as she enters the marble doors.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Riven’s fingers played along the edges of her blade’s runic inscription – an idle habit, long deprived of meaning. Her thoughts went where they often went in darkness: to dark memories. She gritted her teeth. There was nothing quite so cutting as the recollection of a guilty mind.
        \n\n
        She twitched, involuntarily, as the scene of her death unraveled before her.
        \n\n
        A damp fog yawned across the valley floor sheepishly, as though reluctant to conceal the horrors of the day. The gagging stench would have betrayed its effort, had not the smell so thoroughly permeated the Ionian countryside. Death was now a permanent resident of the somber isle, and its purchase grew with every passing hour. After so many similar fields, Riven no longer took account of it.
        \n\n
        Dusk was settling as the company marched on, the stamp of their boots thick and dull crossing the grimy stretch. Riven’s own boots were becoming stained a deep brown by the mud. She felt a pang of nausea as she realized it wasn’t rainwater that dampened the soil.
        \n\n
        She forced the thought out of her head. There would be more fields, more fogs, more harrowing muck – she could process it all later. “Focus is essential,” her drill instructor used to bark. “A lot happens in the chaos of battle, but you can only accomplish one thing at a time.”
        Now it was marching.
        \n\n
        Fury Company had trudged for days to catch up with the rest of the 42nd Standard, and the dreary trail through the Zaunite Melters’ aftermath was... messy. War was all about casualties, but the rising number of civilian losses was staggering. The High Command had expected the peace-loving Ionians to roll over and surrender in the face of Noxus’ military juggernaut. Instead the resistance was fierce and unrelenting. For a society that preached pacifism, the Ionians didn’t hesitate to get their hands dirty.
        \n\n
        Riven was impressed.
        \n\n
        This was a particularly grim scene. The Coeur Valley was one of the few passageways through which the Melters could cross the foothills of northern Shon-Xan. The Ionians had made a desperate stand there that morning, hoping to stem or slow the pace of Zaun’s death machines. It was a telling failure for Ionia. They hadn’t even managed to scramble half the forces Noxian intelligence had predicted, and ample countermeasures were taken long before the Melters attempted the pass. Still, for such a meager resistance, Riven couldn’t help but notice the abundance of Noxian uniforms littered amongst the dead.
        \n\n
        A day or two behind, the Noxian cleanup effort was requesting reinforcements.
        \n\n
        Riven’s attention was drawn to the path by the sound of advancing footsteps. Someone was approaching the group from the front. Riven raised her blade high, halting the company and eclipsing herself beneath it. It was a true Noxian weapon, built to instill fear at sight alone.
        \n\n
        The figure emerged from the fog. It was a girl, a couple years older than Riven, stumbling as she walked. Her clothes were torn and matted with blood. When she saw the company, her eyes went wide.
        \n\n
        “No no no no no,” she muttered. “No more, please.” She fell to her knees and started weeping.
        \n\n
        Riven ordered two men to retrieve the girl. Handling civilians was a chore that had wearied the men over the past several weeks. They’d been trained to kill soldiers in battle, not to dispatch helpless bystanders. Ionia didn’t even have a standing military.
        Only the strong survive, Riven reminded herself.
        \n\n
        The two soldiers reached the girl and stood to either side, each silently hoping the other would take the lead. Riven was about to intervene when the girl made a quick motion and a thin red mist appeared in front of her. The two soldiers crumpled, dead before they hit the ground.
        \n\n
        “Ambush!” Her warning was lost amongst the cries of her soldiers. On all sides of the company, corpses were rising, weapons in hand, and charging into their ranks. Except they weren’t dead. Their eyes were very much alive with hateful resolve. Riven remembered the intelligence reports: less than half the expected opposition. It was a trap. The Ionians had planned this all along.
        \n\n
        Already the rear guard was overtaken. Riven screamed for the unit to collapse to a defensive formation. The army needed to be warned. She drew a distress flare from her belt and fired into the darkening sky. Pale green light illuminated the entire valley.
        One of the Ionians leapt out at Riven. She slashed upward, bisecting him lengthwise. The Ionians had the advantage, but Riven wasn’t one to surrender. If they could defeat her in combat, they deserved this victory. The strong would prevail.
        \n\n
        The remaining Noxian soldiers tightened their ranks, backs to each other. Nearly half the company was already dead or dying. The Ionians were taking their time now, savoring the growing Noxian despair.
        \n\n
        They were surrounded and outnumbered. Her men were tired, demoralized. The Ionians, by contrast, were fueled by their hate. She wondered how long they had lain there, amongst the bodies of fallen friends, waiting for this moment. She tightened her grip on the sword. One way or another, she would end this.
        \n\n
        A blinding ball of light erupted thirty feet in front of her, sending Ionians flying. Riven spun, looking for a source, just as another explosion hit the edge of the Noxian circle. Riven’s ears were ringing, all she could hear was her heartbeat. Noxian and Ionian soldiers were in chaos, some fighting, some running, some… clawing at their skin.
        And then she realized it. The Melters had opened fire on them.
        \n\n
        Only the strong survive, she repeated… but that was meaningless here. Nobody would survive. By all rights, the Ionians should have won this fight, but they too would die. How did this follow the Noxian way?
        \n\n
        As she fled the cursed valley, explosions rocked the ground around her. Soldiers on both sides were subjected to horrific, unspeakable deaths. Something changed in her then. The conviction with which she charged boldly to war had evaporated, and without it she was… lost.
        \n\n
        The memory neared its conclusion. Though she’d relived it a thousand times over, Riven never understood why that day went the way it did. She didn’t know why Noxus depended on Zaun’s horrific techmaturgy instead of its own military. She didn’t know why she didn’t see the ambush coming. She didn’t know why she survived.
        “Why do you want to join the League, Riven?” Behind her, the weeping girl stood, matted in blood, tears running down her cheeks. But the voice was out of place.
        \n\n
        “This isn’t right...” Riven started, but the valley around her was melting away. This was some kind of trick.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Riven?”
        \n\n
        “What are you-”
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League?” Impatience.
        \n\n
        “I don’t know!” Riven spat. She was stung by the invasion of her mind. She’d lived with this memory for years, but it was something she wouldn’t, couldn’t share. She took a deep breath, “I fought for something once, but it was a lie.” Spoken in her own voice, the words hurt to hear. “I still love Noxus, I never stopped. But now… I want to fight on my own terms.”
        \n\n
        “How does it feel, exposing your mind?”
        \n\n
        Riven let the question turn in her mind. So many times she wanted to confide in someone, to let someone else shoulder the burden. But telling the story – even watching it through her own eyes – didn’t ease the pain. It was hers alone, and some things could never be shared.
        \n\n
        “Exposed or not, it changes nothing.”
        \n\n
        Then the girl was gone, and she was alone in the Institute. Her broken sword glowed dimly at her side. The illusion was invasive, but she’d almost forgotten the former heft of her sword. As if in response, a faint green outline played out from the shard, tracing the blade’s former curve. She felt a sudden wash of reassurance. Perhaps she wasn’t so lost after all.

    <Story>Even amongst yordles, Rumble was always the runt of the litter. As such, he was used to being bullied. In order to survive, he had to be scrappier and more resourceful than his peers. He developed a quick temper and a reputation for getting even, no matter who crossed him. This made him something of a loner, but he didn't mind. He liked to tinker, preferring the company of gadgets, and he could usually be found rummaging through the junkyard. He showed great potential as a mechanic. His teachers recommended him for enrollment at the Yordle Academy of Science and Progress in Piltover, where he may very well have become one of Heimerdinger's esteemed protégés, but Rumble refused to go.  He believed that Heimerdinger and his associates were ''sellouts,'' trading superior yordle technology to humans for nothing more than a pat on the head while yordles remained the butt of their jokes. When a group of human graduates from the Yordle Academy sailed to Bandle City to visit the place where their mentor was born and raised, Rumble couldn't resist the temptation to see them face-to-face (so to speak). He only intended to get a good look at the humans, but four hours and several choice words later, he returned home bruised and bloodied with an earful about how he was an embarrassment to ''enlightened'' yordles like Heimerdinger. The next morning he left Bandle City without a word, and wasn't seen again for months. When he returned, he was at the helm of a clanking, mechanized monstrosity.  He marched it to the center of town amidst dumbfounded onlookers and there announced that he would join the League of Legends to show the world what yordle-tech was really capable of, without hiding behind a foreign banner.\n\n''Ugh, it's gonna take forever to scrape your face off my suit!'' - Rumble\n\n</Story>

    <Judgment date="22 April, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Rumble clanks into the Great Hall with the least grace shown by any candidate since Gragas. He battles with the controls of his scraped-together battle-suit, peculiarly named "Tristy". The suit lumbers forward, a marvel of unrefined construction. Rumble’s movements are jerky, quick; he seems to enjoy the frantic micromanagement.
        \n\n
        The great ball of spikes that is Tristy’s left hand rears back in front of the doors. As though self-aware, they fling open abruptly and the Reflecting Chamber’s impenetrable darkness unfurls into the Great Hall. Rumble snorts with derision before urging the machine forward.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Humans did love playing their games. Rumble doubted that important humans like Prince Jarvan were dumped in a dark broom closet while some League goon got all fancied up for a beat down.
        \n\n
        "Oh well, if the longlegs want to see what kind of champion I’ll be, I’m happy to show ‘em."
        \n\n
        He was bubbling with anticipation. "Itchy fist syndrome" someone once called it, except now his "fists" consisted of a pressurized, two-cylinder flame projection system and a pneumatic piston-mace assembly Rumble often referred to as "the short hello".
        \n\n
        He was only worried for the guy they’d sent to test him.
        \n\n
        "No need to worry," growled a gravelly, robotic voice behind him, "I will take it easy on you!"
        \n\n
        Rumble hammered the control yoke, spinning Tristy’s cockpit 180 degrees with nauseating speed. He half-pulled the trigger to launch his electro-harpoon before he realized he was staring at a wall.
        \n\n
        "Over here now!" The voice was behind him again, amused.
        \n\n
        Rumble punched one of the pedals when he spun back, whirling to face the owner of the voice. The instant the cockpit came to a stop, the harpoon misfired, hurtling straight for the poor League crony. Normally Rumble preferred to look someone in the eye before he impaled them on an electrified javelin, but he certainly wasn’t one to stand on ceremony.
        \n\n
        As his eyes came to rest on the target, his enthusiasm evaporated.
        \n\n
        The harpoon plinked harmlessly off the shiny, finished exterior of a titanic battle-suit. It stood easily four times the height of Rumble’s, supported by three multi-jointed legs thick enough to withstand mortar fire. Above them, the chest – an almond-shaped slab inset with purple gems – was visibly generating some sort of arcano-magnetic deflection field. The glowing plate was flanked by confoundingly intricate arm appendages which both suspended tactical, sixteen-cell missile arrays. Rumble knew by the heads of the missiles that each was outfitted with sorcerous motion tracking and remote guidance systems. The arms terminated in two ten-barrel rotary cannons nestled in exterior composite plating. The leering head of the behemoth was a fat bulb of tinted glass coated in sensory detection equipment, presumably housing the pilot. Where its mouth would have been, a gleaming cylinder protruded, clearly the business end of a focused-energy charging plasma emitter. In other words: a death ray. Worst of all, the armor of the colossus was anodized and decorated in flawless detail with blue flames, the exact pattern Rumble wanted to paint on his suit.
        \n\n
        Someone ripped off his dream design.
        \n\n
        Rumble’s fury overtook his awe. With a howl, he pulled every trigger, punched every button, and kicked every pedal that would fire something at the hulking monstrosity. In response, his trusty suit Tristy sputtered and fell over.
        \n\n
        Rumble tumbled from his seat, cursing. One of these days, he would install seat belts…right after he finished the designs for the Juicer. He rolled to his feet and gave Tristy a firm kick in the mace – the usual fix. Tristy shuddered back to life, but she became suddenly obscured by a looming shadow.
        \n\n
        Rumble blinked.
        \n\n
        When he opened his eyes, his vision was filled by one of the giant’s tree trunk legs. It twisted slightly, and the wail of grinding alloys confirmed Rumble’s worst fear.
        \n\n
        Tristy had been stomped flat.
        \n\n
        There have been times in Rumble’s life when he’s had lapses of memory. They usually occurred when he was being bullied or beaten badly enough that he didn’t think he’d pull through. Things just went dark. Usually when he’d come out of it, there would be a bunch of yordles either on the ground bloodied or looking at him like he had a wrench sticking out of his head (which was only actually the case once).
        \n\n
        In this instance, he was clawing madly at the foot of the steel mammoth, throat hoarse and fur in disarray. The foot remained in good condition.
        \n\n
        With a popping hiss, the head of the beast split open, revealing an unmistakable bushy blonde afro.
        \n\n
        “Heimerdinger!” Rumble bellowed, “You’re gonna pay for this! Deserter! Traitor! Get down here!” His voice cracked more times than he’d have liked.
        \n\n
        “That would be a poor strategy indeed!” Heimerdinger exclaimed, after brief consideration. “You can return to Bandle City. I’m sorry it didn’t work out!”
        \n\n
        “Return?!” Rumble laughed. “You think I’m done with you? This fight just got started! You already-” He was airborne before he could finish his sentence. It looked like something shot out from the death machine and exploded in front of him, but his vision was so blurry he couldn’t confirm it. He soared almost casually through the air until the wall stopped him.
        \n\n
        “The probability of your continued existence is rapidly approaching zero.” Heimerdinger remarked absent-mindedly.
        \n\n
        Rumble opened his eyes and coaxed his lungs to breathe. He was lying on his side facing Heimerdinger. Neither the wall nor the floor did a good job cushioning his fall. He wasn’t going to be able to take many more shots like these.
        \n\n
        “You missed.” He choked, managing a smirk. He wobbled to his feet, bracing himself against the wall.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Rumble?” He thought Heimerdinger’s voice sounded strange, but it was difficult to tell through the ringing in his ears.
        \n\n
        “Oh now you want to chit-chat.”
        \n\n
        “Your machine is destroyed. You will be unable to compete without-“
        \n\n
        “Why’s that? I’m too small? Too weak? Tell me a new one. I’m the one they invited here, not my machine, and I’m not leaving that easy. Bandle City needs more loyal champions, and I’m not gonna back down from some big-haired Piltover lapdog.” Broken and battered, Rumble’s voice didn’t lose any attitude. He brought his fists up, the motion was excruciating.
        \n\n
        “How does it feel exposing your mind?”
        \n\n
        “How does it-? What kind of question is that? Let’s finish this! You’re gonna pay for what you did to Trist-”
        \n\n
        Heimerdinger was gone. Rumble was sitting in the cockpit, looking at Tristy’s instrument panel. The pain was gone. He was back in the broom closet, but someone apparently turned the lights on. He couldn’t suppress the smile that crept across his face. He hugged the dashboard.
        \n\n
        “I thought I lost you for a second there, girl. But don’t worry, I would’ve fixed you. Now we gotta go pay someone back for this whole mess.”
        \n\n
        He took hold of the yolks and kicked the pedals. Tristy sprung to action, leaping forward.
        \n\n
        Then she sputtered and fell over.

  <Champion name="Ryze" title="The Rogue Mage" range="550" gender="m" rp="260" ip="450" abilityVideoID="0013">
    <Story>There are many on Runeterra who are attracted to the study of magic or, in recent times, the emerging field of techmaturgy. For most, pursuit of such knowledge is formalized in a college or university. The halls of traditional study were never for Ryze, however, who felt a more raw and primal connection to the magic of Runeterra than those who tried to teach him. He struck out on his own as a young man to discover what already called to him. Ryze traveled the world, seeking the wisdom of powerful hermits, witches, and shamans - anyone who had something to share beyond what was taught in the city-states of Valoran. When he had learned all he could from these fonts of wisdom, Ryze turned to seek the lost, forgotten, and forbidden knowledge in the world, delving into mystical worlds where others feared to tread.\n\nRyze's tireless searching for magical knowledge led him to an ancient form of spellcraft known as thorn magic. This art required Ryze to tattoo spells on his body, permanently infusing his being with vast arcane power and finally fulfilling his need to bond with the mystical energies of Runeterra. His travels also led him to uncover the giant indestructible scroll he now carries on his back - the purpose of the inscribed spell remains a secret only Ryze knows. He claims it is an abomination - something that he must safeguard from the world. This has piqued the curiosity of many, though no one is sure how to separate the scroll from Ryze, or if it is possible to overcome the rogue mage to do so. Since then, Ryze has joined the League of Legends to study the magical creatures and powerful will-workers that fight there, in order to complete his exploration of mystical Runeterra.\n\n''Ryze is no longer just a mage - he has become a creature of magic itself.''\n-High Councilor Heywan Relivash</Story>

      <Observation>
        Ryze strides along the marbles halls; face deliberate, jaw set and determined. His eyes hold a sense of urgency and undeniable purpose that is mirrored in his gait. His simple traveler's clothes pose a stark contrast to the elaborate tattoos that snake their way across his wiry frame, marring every inch of his exposed flesh.
        \n\n
        Slung over his powerful back hangs a scroll; precious cargo from how he cradles it. From the embossed spellbook in his grip to the lesser scraps of parchment at his side, nothing is borne with more reverence. He stops for a moment beneath an archway marked by a double door and an inscription: "The truest opponent lies within." The Rogue Mage extends a hand, parting the portal, before striding boldly inside.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Ryze stood for a moment in the dark, calm but alert. He sniffed the air. There was something here... a tangible presence.
        \n\n
        "A visitor?" called a voice from the black, "How strange. I loathe uninvited guests!"
        \n\n
        Every muscle in his body tightened like a coiled spring. Out of the darkness strode a lithe, beautiful woman, dressed in a loose fitting dress. From neck to fingertips, she was covered in tattoos.
        \n\n
        "Lilith?" he gasped, "How did you find me?"
        \n\n
        She reached out a slender hand, lightly drawing her long nails down Ryze's bare chest.
        \n\n
        "Ryze," she purred, "You cannot hide from me." She drew in closer, catching him in her embrace. "I have a secret," she whispered, pulling herself close to his cheek. "I will never let you go!" she snarled, biting his earlobe suggestively. He shivered.
        \n\n
        The pinch in his ear became a sharp sting. He heard an impact and fell reeling to the ground, catching himself on pure, unmarked hands. He recognized them as his own, but that was impossible. He hadn't seen his bare flesh in years.
        \n\n
        "Trespasser!" rasped Lilith's voice.
        \n\n
        "Pardon, mistress," he started, climbing to his feet on the ramshackled porch of a lonely cabin, "I am weary and in search of shelter for the evening. The Howling Marsh is no place to be caught after dark."
        \n\n
        "I do not shelter insufferable wayfarers," she replied, folding her arms implacably. A slight breeze caught her wild hair.
        \n\n
        Ryze sneered. "I am not to be trifled with..."
        \n\n
        She cut him off. "Trifled?!" she screeched, extending a finger. Energy crackled along the patterns on her arm, racing across the distance between them. First it was just the jolt. The breath rushed from his lungs and for a moment he blacked out. The next thing he knew he was lying on his back in the mud, gasping. His body tingled, and he shook from head to foot. Lilith stood over him, silhouetted in the setting sun, energy still coursing along the ink in her tattoos.
        \n\n
        "You will learn respect, vagabond," she said, even voiced once again.
        \n\n
        "Please, mistress," Ryze gasped, "spare my life."
        \n\n
        She knelt over him, leaning in just inches from his nose, her hair falling into his face. She dug her fingernails into the shirt over his chest, "Why, pretty thing? Why should I spare your life?"
        \n\n
        He inhaled sharply through the pain in his chest, "Because I have been searching for you for my entire life," he stammered, "and it would break my heart to die, now."
        \n\n
        Lilith sat up slightly. She smiled. "How interesting," she replied. Ryze's strength failed him and he passed out.
        \n\n
        He awoke lying face down on a plush mattress, arms and legs spread wide. He tried to move, but found himself bound tightly in place. Next to him on the pillow lay a series of razor sharp thorns and a font of violet liquid.
        \n\n
        "Awake so soon," Lilith muttered coyly, entering the room through a beaded curtain. She climbed onto the bed with him, straddling his lower back. "Tell me, wayfarer," she quipped, reaching for her implements, "what is it about me that is so fascinating?" She dipped a barb into the inkwell.
        \n\n
        "I have studied magic since I was a boy," Ryze croaked into the pillow. He felt a twinge in the nape of his neck and he winced.
        \n\n
        "Don’t squirm!" Lilith shouted, bringing a hand down hard on his shoulder with an audible smack. Ryze gritted his teeth through the pain and continued. The burning sensation spread as she went about her bloody work.
        \n\n
        "Always, my masters taught me patience, to remain in control, to never surrender to my passions," she changed needles. He could feel blood and ink pooling in his open wounds. "They called me a liability; refused to finish training me," he went on, "You know another way."
        \n\n
        "Charlatans," Lilith spat, wiping the blood from his back with her dress. She bent low over him, her hot breath on his neck. She whispered, "but we know better, don't we. Magic is energy. All our enthusiasm; our rapture; our fury. They are conduits for our power." She licked her lips. "I can show you the way."
        \n\n
        She freed his limbs. "Now roll over," she snapped, another needle clutched lightly in her fingers, "I haven't finished."
        \n\n
        Ryze grudgingly obeyed, though his body throbbed with pain. Above him in the rafters hung an elaborate scroll on stretched parchment, larger than a tapestry. "What is that?" he asked, remembering himself.
        \n\n
        Lilith's face grew ashen. The room around him fell away to darkness. "You stole it from me!" she shrieked, arms flailing, tears streaming down her face, "How could you?! Betrayer! Betrayer!" She struck him a dozen times before he could restrain her.
        \n\n
        "I had no choice!" he cried, "You wouldn't listen! You would bring ruin on us all!"
        \n\n
        Lilith scoffed. "Why do you want to join the League, Ryze?"
        \n\n
        Ryze released her and she pulled away. He adjusted the scroll on his back. "I must keep it safe."
        \n\n
        She smiled. "How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        Ryze determined countenance returned. "I will do what I must," he replied.
        \n\n
        He raised a hand to shield his face as the doors to the League of Legends swung open, and light came pouring in.

    <Story>
      When Sejuani was born, the mystics of her tribe foretold that she would be the one to unite and lead the divided territories of Freljord. Her people had suffered for centuries, as a losing war on the frozen tundra pushed them farther and farther from Freljord's limited food supplies. Sejuani grew up surrounded by this misery, and it fueled her desire to fulfill her destiny. She pushed herself to extremes, walking out into blizzards without food or furs and training while frigid winds raked her flesh. She sparred with the strongest warriors of her tribe, one after another, until her legs would give out beneath her. She sustained injuries that would have killed any other member of the tribe, but she would only rise again, driven by sheer force of will and what her tribe took to calling her "heart of the blizzard."
      \n\n
      On her twentieth birthday, Sejuani declared that she would lead her people out of their remote isolation to conquer the lands of their enemies. She had completed her training and she was ready to face the leaders of the opposing tribes. Her feats had already become legend and soldiers in her company were inspired to new heights of strength and resolve. However, before she struck out on her campaign, Ashe began campaigning for peace in Freljord, joining the League of Legends to demonstrate how the people could be spared violence. To Sejuani, this was a violation of tradition – a coward’s ruse to hoard Freljord's precious few resources. She saw the confidence of her people wane as it seemed they would never be delivered from their plight. She decided that to truly prove herself as the rightful ruler of Freljord, she must defeat Ashe completely and unquestionably on the world’s stage in the League of Legends.

  <Champion name="Shaco" title="The Demon Jester" range="125" gender="m" rp="975" ip="3150" spotlight="Q9m48jiVWL4" abilityVideoID="0035">
    <Story>Most would say that death isn't funny. It isn't, unless you're Shaco - then it's hysterical. He is Valoran's first fully functioning homicidal comic; he jests until someone dies, and then he laughs. The figure that has come to be known as the Demon Jester is an enigma. No one fully agrees from whence he came, and Shaco never offers any details on his own. A popular belief is that Shaco is not of Runeterra - that he is a thing summoned from a dark and twisted world. Still others believe that he is the demonic manifestation of humanity's dark urges and therefore cannot be reasoned with. The most plausible belief is that Shaco is an assassin for hire, left to his own lunatic devices until his services are needed. Shaco certainly has proven himself to be a cunning individual, evading authorities at every turn who might seek him for questioning for some horrendous, law-breaking atrocity. While such scuttlebutt might reassure the native inhabitants of Valoran, it seems unimaginable that such a malfeasant figure is allowed to remain at large.\n\nWhatever the truth of his history might be, Shaco has joined the League of Legends for reasons only he knows. He is a terrifying figure, typically shunned by both his fellow champions and the media at large. Only the summoners in the Institute of War know why such a creature was allowed into the League, but most Runeterrans suspect it to be a means that allows the power that be to keep an eye on the ever-elusive Shaco. Unsurprisingly, this champion is popular in places where madness can openly reign, such as among the power-hungry summoners of Zaun and Noxus.\n\nWhatever you do, don't tell him you missed the punch line.</Story>

    <Story>There exists an ancient order originating in the Ionian Isles dedicated to the preservation of balance.  Order, chaos, light, darkness -- all things must exist in perfect harmony for such is the way of the universe.  This order is known as the Kinkou and it employs a triumvirate of shadow warriors to uphold its causes in the world.  Shen is one of these shadow warriors, entrusted with the sacred duty of Watching the Stars - exercising judgment untainted by prejudice.\n\nBorn to a clan whose members have decorated the ranks of the Kinkou for generations, Shen was trained his entire life to become the Eye of Twilight, and thereupon to dispassionately determine what must be done in the interests of equilibrium.  As his final trial to ascend to this position, he was made to attend the Takanu, a ceremony in which his father was tortured before his eyes to test his resolve.  Any reaction whatsoever would have resulted in his immediate disqualification, but he never averted his gaze and never blinked, not once.  As the Eye of Twilight, Shen must make decisions that would buckle the wills of ordinary men, removing all emotion from the equation.  He now works with his fellows Akali and Kennen to enforce the balance of Valoran.  This hallowed pursuit has unsurprisingly led the triumvirate to the Fields of Justice.\n\nThe Eye of Twilight sees not the despair of its victims, only the elegance of equilibrium.</Story>

    <Story>
      There are those few dragons in Runeterra who have mastered the intense magical energies that course through their unique anatomies, evolving into an elusive Celestial Dragon. These powerful and enigmatic creatures spend most of their time hidden away from the lands of men. However, there are those who find themselves drawn to civilization and who take on human forms to immerse themselves in the world of humans. Occasionally, one finds itself drawn to the spirit of a human and they have relations. Sometimes, in the slimmest of odds, the union will bear fruit and that offspring will be one of the few half-dragons to have graced Runeterra. Shyvana is one such creature, born to a simple Demacian farm-girl and her Celestial Dragon father. Left to be raised by her mother, her oddities were something that couldn't be hidden from her community, though she was protected by her family. Once her family had perished in disaster, she was left alone for the first time – truly alone. Shyvana quickly became an outsider and it wasn't long before the community's fear began to put her in danger. Facing mortal danger at the business end of an angry mob, she was rescued by the traveling noble, Jarvan Lightshield. The noble was a man who strangely knew exactly what she was and took her under his wing. It wasn't long before she was offered a chance to use her natural skills in the service of Demacia, as Jarvan initiated her as one of the elite guard. Following Jarvan into the League of Legends was only natural.
      \n\n
      Shyvana is a fierce warrior, with the blood of one of the most powerful magical predators in all creation flowing through her veins. Unlike some of her fellows, she is a subdued personality – somber, cool, and collected. However, when the moment strikes, her draconian heritage manifests and there are few that can stare her in the eyes and not feel the primal urge to flee.
      \n\n

  <Champion name="Singed" title="The Mad Chemist" range="125" gender="m" rp="585" ip="1350" spotlight="ZOpT__qwjdQ" abilityVideoID="0027">
    <Story>Singed descended from a long line of Zaun's revered chemists. Even in his youth, his talent for concocting potions far outstripped that of his peers, and he quickly distinguished himself from his less extraordinary chemist compatriots. It came as no surprise to anyone when he was selected for apprenticeship by the infamous Warwick, master apothecary on a lucrative retainer with the Noxian military during their campaign against Ionia. Within Warwick's laboratories, Singed toiled without end, rapidly absorbing every detail of his predecessor's deadly craft. Singed had little concern for the death and destruction that was the fruit of his labors. By the time the curse of lycanthropy descended to claim his master, Singed was poised and eager to make the transition from workhorse to innovator; he was ready to share his genius by bringing a new brand of suffering to the Ionian front. His zeal for progress was unquenchable, and when suitable test subjects proved to be in short supply, the eager chemist was often thought to turn his volatile mixtures on his own flesh.\n\nWhen the uneasy peace created by the League of Legends settled on the world, Singed journeyed to the one place where he was still able to showcase his beloved craft: the Institute of War. By this time he was barely even a man, his body both ruined and sustained by his ingenious craft. A thousand burns - accidents of shadow and flame - mar his ravaged form, and exposure to such harsh conditions has deadened his nerves, hardened his body, and strengthened his physique, transforming him into a veritable juggernaut. This, combined with a formidable arsenal of deadly concoctions, makes Singed a force to be reckoned with on the Fields of Justice.\n\n''My deadliest dose shall bear my patron's name!'' - Singed, having just christened the Insanity Potion</Story>

    <Story>Prior to the creation of the League of Legends, the city-states of Demacia and Noxus were locked in a brutal series of on-again-off-again wars that spanned the course of centuries.  Both powers sought an advantage over the other, but Noxus was the city-state willing to forego conventional morality to achieve its goals.  Only brute strength and the will to use it mattered to Noxus, and this is best exemplified in the murderous warrior, Sion.  Used by the Noxians as a human battering ram, Sion would be sent thundering ahead of Noxian troops.  He would mercilessly slaughter foes with his large double-bladed axe, ''Chopper''. His complete disregard for caution ultimately cost him his life, as he was captured and summarily executed by Demacian forces.\n\nThe Demacians thought that the beheading of Sion would be the end of his bloodthirsty ways.  Death, however, was merely the beginning of Sion's rise to power.  The famed Noxian assassin, Katarina, recovered Sion's remains and Noxian necromancers reanimated the behemoth to serve Noxus once again.  Sion's reanimation actually bestowed new powers on him and increased the potency of his existing abilities, making him even more of a terror to behold on the battlefield.  The Noxian High Command had a powerful new weapon in their hands - one they have brought to bear as a champion in the League of Legends.  Even though Sion's increased powers would make him a powerful tool for the High Command's use outside the Fields of Justice, Noxus no longer risks losing one of their greatest champions in the League to chance or circumstance; Sion's days as a front-line fighter for Noxus' military conquests are at an end.\n\n''For Noxus, death is a promotion.'' -- Pantheon</Story>

    <Story>The beautiful and deadly champion known as Sivir has been a favorite of League summoners for close to a decade.  A soldier-for-hire outside of the Fields of Justice, she is the embodiment of a highly successful mercenary on modern day Runeterra.  Sivir has little interest in the ''cribbage sheets'' - as she calls them - of League influence bartering.  Instead, she is motivated by material wealth and riches, and she is paid handsomely for her services.  Sivir is one of the wealthiest individuals found anywhere on Valoran.  Sivir owns multiple residences in a number of different city-states, as well as ownership stakes in a number of businesses all across Valoran.  Her detractors, either envious of her success or acrimonious of her flexible morality, have begun to use Sivir as a symbol of what is wrong with the mercenary nature of the League.  Sivir dismisses her critics, saying that while her personal code of ethics is less ruthless than her competitors, ''Everyone has a price.''\n\nSivir has earned many titles and accolades throughout her illustrious career, but the one she held until recently was ''Battle Mistress of Noxus''. Now she is simply known as ''The Battle Mistress'' after breaking her contract with the Noxian High Command.  Sivir dared to object to the Noxian war against the peaceful island state of Ionia, though less about the morality of the issue than the planning behind it; her predictions of a bloody stalemate came true when the Ionians held off the relentless assaults of the Noxians.  Claiming that the Noxian High Command had lost its direction, she left Noxus and made her services available to the Institute of War.  The Noxian High Command has sent a number of contracted assassins to deal with its rogue mercenary, but none have delivered her or survived.\n\n''Time and time again, Sivir proves that she has earned the right to call herself 'The Battle Mistress'.'' -- Jax</Story>

    <Story>Centuries ago, there lived a race of creatures as ferocious as they were wise. The brackern were unusual beings blessed with the earth's primal magic, embodied in the form of crystals. Their kind knew of an arcane ritual to bind their life's essence to a crystal, communing with the magic embedded in it. With this power, the brackern thrived in the Odyn Valley, protecting both creatures and crystals alike. Despite attacks from those looking to claim the primal magic, it seemed that nothing could get past the brackern's defenses. Nothing, that is, until the devastation of a Rune War.\n\nA vicious battle was fought near the Odyn Valley and the unleashed chaotic magic poisoned the crystals. The brackern began to grow sick and die, and no amount of defensive magic could reverse the effects. To avoid extinction, their only course was to hibernate underground until the wars stopped. The strongest, most intelligent brackern hibernated closer to the surface to awaken first and assess the world's condition for the return of their race. The recent mining operations and violent escalation in Kalamanda were enough to awaken the first of these vanguards. When Skarner burst to the surface, he lashed out in anger and confusion. Reason eventually won out over his anger when he realized that the agents of the League who found him were simply functionaries. Skarner was invited to the Institute of War to share the brackern's story. In return, the summoners told him about the history that his kind had slept through. Much had been done to curb the unchecked use of magic since the Rune Wars, but it was obvious that the world was not yet safe for his kind to reawaken. For now, however, there is a place where Skarner can use his power to change the world into one to which his kind could eventually return: the League of Legends.\n\n"The humans have not yet learned to control their magic - what once was Kalamanda is now a crystal scar on the history of this world."\n- Skarner</Story>

    <Judgment date="5 August, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        The silence is eerie. The village was once an endless flurry of activity, with the chorus of pickaxes, rolling mining carts, and shouts of laborers comprising the song of Kalamanda audible during every moment of the day. Now, it is deathly silent, lacking even the far-away cries of birds or the whispers of winds moving through the grass. A blue bubble shimmers overhead, enclosing all life inside without regard to the malice or innocence present in the hearts of the trapped.
        \n\n
        Suddenly, the ground in the center of the village bursts upwards. The League recovery crew stationed in Kalamanda is unprepared, staring blankly as a wickedly sharp crystal rises out of the ground. It lingers for a moment, as if tasting the air, and suddenly shoots out towards the humans standing close by. They barely manage to dodge out of the way, stumbling over themselves as the rest of the body attached to the crystal surges through the dirt.
        \n\n
        It is a massive creature, seemingly carved out of the earth's most precious gemstones. The light gleams off of each facet of its segmented body, a halo crowning the unnatural creature's birth into the world. Menacing claws lash out towards the humans, snapping at everything in its path. The League crew defend themselves the best that they can, yelling out hopelessly to yield.
        \n\n
        The crystal scorpion lets out a guttural roar, one that is as full of anger as it is of sorrow.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Skarner scurried through the Institute of War, his limbs cramped from trying to avoid scraping his sides on the tiny hallways. It didn't help that humans kept cluttering the way, staring at him instead of making space for their unexpected visitor. An escort led him through an enormous set of double doors, where a human was waiting alone in a dark room. He was relieved to be away from prying eyes, though he knew that what was to come would pry into him far more deeply.
        \n\n
        The human's honest demeanor betrayed his purpose before he even spoke.
        \n\n
        "I am Bertrand Wordsworth, keeper of history in the Arcanum Majoris. It is an incredible honor to meet one of your kind. I have never found any mention of the brackern in all my studies." Bertrand's eyes darted about, taking in Skarner's impressive form.
        \n\n
        "So it would seem that humans seek to eliminate our species, but the knowledge that we ever existed at all as well." Skarner replied evenly.
        \n\n
        The historian flushed. "I apologize for being so forward. I wasn't thinking."
        \n\n
        "No. It is I who should be apologizing." Skarner's jaws clenched. "Forgive me. This new world is so very strange, and the grievances of centuries past are still recent to my memory."
        \n\n
        "Understandably so."
        \n\n
        "So, shall we get on with your rituals of judgment, then" The brackern was eager to be away.
        \n\n
        "On the contrary, your little show back in the village, in addition to our conversations, has already answered all of our questions regarding your eligibility for entry into the League. Your commitment to fight for your kind to return is honorable. It is also a thrill for us to receive one as unique as yourself into the organization." He hesitated.
        \n\n
        "But you want to know the story of the brackern."
        \n\n
        "Indeed." Bertrand raised a scroll in his hand. "I have a spell here, one that will take us back in time."
        \n\n
        The crystal scorpion did not answer for a moment. The desire to see his brothers again was too strong to ignore, but he knew the cost. He nodded his consent.
        \n\n
        A swell of magic flared through the room. Suddenly, Skarner was again seeing the world as it once was.
        \n\n
        The cold dirt of the earth surrounded him, a comforting sensation on his tired limbs. He recognized the exhaustion and madness that consumed him he was in the final moments of his life's quest. Skarner had not seen his kind for years, journeying into the depths of the mountains to find the one crystal in the world that would resonate with his life essence. Skarner's desperation threatened to consume him, after unearthing crystal after crystal that was not meant to be his. With his last ounce of strength, he reached out with his claws through the dirt and finally found the Arachia that would bind to him for the rest of his life.
        \n\n
        Skarner uncovered it carefully, relief and awe washing over him, leaving him breathless. The crystal was the largest of any that he had ever seen, let alone those that had responded to a brackern. He pored over the intricate carvings sprawled across every gleaming facet, marveling at the residue from the earth weaving its knowledge into the gemstone for centuries. Skarner curled around the crystal as it began to pulse, soothing all his fears that he would die alone in disgrace if he hadn't found his Arachia.
        \n\n
        He murmured the words of binding, and felt his soul sing as it became one with the earth. His first meditation with the crystal left him paralyzed for days, the knowledge of eons past flooding into his mind. The voices of the natural world whispered to him, sharing the secrets of primal magic and the history of centuries past. In the decades that followed, Skarner communed with the crystal almost daily, and only barely started to explore all of the knowledge imbued within it. Skarner passed on everything he had learned to his fellow brackern, and each creature in turn fed the knowledge back into his own Arachia for future brackern.
        \n\n
        Then, a devastating explosion rocked the land. Skarner knew what was coming next.
        \n\n
        Seconds later, a noxious cloud engulfed the valley, and the crystals vibrated with an alien glow. A piercing hum grew in volume to a deafening shriek. One by one, the crystals began to shatter, spraying glowing shrapnel in all directions. The brackern that were bound to the crystals screamed, dropping to the ground in writhing agony.
        \n\n
        Chaos erupted. The brackern called healing magics upon their dying brothers and conjured up shields around the valley. But it was all to no avail - the brackern continued to fall until their numbers dwindled. Eventually, the brackern's desperate pleas awoke the ancient magic in the Arachia crystals, who called them underground. The brackern would fuse with the crystals, their mutual strength protecting each other until the world was safe again for both to exist.
        \n\n
        Skarner was one of the last to remain awake, assisting the stragglers underground. His last view of the surface was another wave of unnatural energy rippling through the valley, before he plunged into the ground and cast the spell of hibernation, a prayer for his kind on his tongue.
        \n\n
        Sleep began to overtake him. Suddenly, a piercing glow jolted him awake, and his eyes flew open. His Arachia crystal was pulsing, and the scorpion knew something was wrong. This had not happened before in his memory. Skarner reached towards the crystal, and he was abruptly tossed backwards in time once again.
        \n\n
        The Odyn Valley appeared as it had long ago, but something was wrong. No brackern were in sight, and humans had overrun the gorge, engaged in war. Robed humans surrounded numerous runes meticulously placed in the center of a circle. Their voices rose in unison, and suddenly the runes fractured and disappeared. In their place, an intense concentration of energy lingered for a second before winking out of existence. A second later, the entire valley shook violently, as an entire city in the distance disappeared in a massive explosion.
        \n\n
        The earth shuddered and reached out with fingers of magic for help. They found small creatures, fierce despite their own size, and called them to crystals hidden deep underground. There, the earth imbued the scorpions with power from the crystals, and from their union, the brackern emerged.
        \n\n
        The scene dissolved around them, bringing them back to the present. Both brackern and human remained silent as the gravity of revelation weighing down upon their hearts.
        \n\n
        Human mistakes robbed them of life. Human mistakes raised them out of nothingness.
        \n\n
        Consumed with rage and sorrow, he roared, lashing his tail wildly around the room. The scorpion slammed the ground repeatedly with his claws, as if he could knock the vivid images of his dying brothers out of his mind. Bertrand barely managed to dive out of the way, cowering in the corner until Skarner's emotions subsided.
        \n\n
        Bertrand eventually spoke.
        \n\n
        "I'm so sorry to make you experience all of that. Yet, it was... necessary." The historian made an honorable, yet poorly veiled attempt to hide his excitement over such an amazing reveal of history.
        \n\n
        The brackern's voice was gruff and low, the weight of loss heavy on him. "To have the story of our kind told and remembered is worth reliving the sorrow a thousand times. Have you all the answers that you came for?
        \n\n
        "Far more than I ever expected." Bertrand was awestruck.
        \n\n
        "Then we are done here."
        \n\n
        Bertrand made a motion as if to comfort the creature, but he knew no words that could bring any sort of relief. He bowed deeply, then turned and fled from the room in a flurry of robes.
        \n\n
        Skarner remained in the room, the bitter sting of realization lingering.
        \n\n
        There was so much in this strange world yet to understand. Every breath, every moment, and every fight in this League of Legends would be a step closer to bringing the brackern closer to living once again.

    <Story>Sona has no memories of her true parents. As an infant, she was found abandoned on the doorstep of an Ionian adoption house, nestled atop an ancient instrument in an exquisite case of unknown origins. She was an unusually well-behaved child, always quiet and content. Her caretakers were sure she would find a home quickly, but it soon became apparent that what they mistook for uncommon geniality was actually an inability to speak or to produce any sound whatsoever. Sona remained at the adoption house until her teens, watching in hopeless silence as prospective adopters passed her by. During this time, the caretakers sold her unusual instrument to anxious collectors, hoping to build her a trust. For a myriad of bizarre and unexpected reasons, however, it would be returned, or simply appear again outside the house.\n\nWhen a wealthy Demacian woman named Lestara Buvelle learned of the instrument, she immediately embarked to Ionia. When the caretakers showcased the instrument for her, she rose wordlessly and explored the house, stopping outside Sona's room. Without hesitation, Lestara adopted her and left a generous donation for the instrument. With Lestara's guidance, Sona discovered a deep connection with the instrument which Lestara called an 'etwahl'. In her hands, it played tones which stilled or quivered the hearts of those around her. Within months, she was headlining with the mysterious etwahl for sold-out audiences. She played as though plucking heartstrings, effortlessly manipulating the emotions of her listeners - all without a single written note. In secret, she discovered a potent and deadly use for her etwahl, using its vibrations to slice objects from a distance. She honed this discipline in private, mastering her gift. When she felt prepared, she went to the only place which could offer her a fitting recital: the League of Legends.\n\n''Her melody moves the soul, her silence sunders the body.''\n- Jericho Swain, after attending her concert</Story>

    <Judgment date="21 September, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Sona glides forward on harmonious winds, her elegant robe billowing softly behind her as she enters the Great Hall. Her hair fans out on an invisible breeze, swaths of aqua dissolving into golden strands at the ends of her long ponytails. She could easily be a fair maiden of magic anywhere on Runeterra, if not for the strange instrument floating before her, appearing to simultaneously protect and guide her.
        \n\n
        The building creaks ever so slightly, the foundations resettling themselves on the bonds of strong magic. She angles her ear towards the sound, holding still for a moment after the sound has long since faded. One can tell that the sound still resonates in her head, being analyzed for tonality, intent, and above all, danger. She doesn’t even bother to glance at her surroundings; the building’s own internal symphony tells her all that she needs to know about this place.
        \n\n
        With the faintest movement, she expertly plucks a single string on her instrument and the double doors in front of her blast open. She enters without hesitation.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The darkness unfurled around her, as deep as the endless chasm of silence that afflicted her. She felt no fear so long as the etwahl was in her grasp. Her arms curled lovingly around the instrument, her fingers expertly trailing along the hammered brass and taut strings. Pressing it against her cheek, she closed her eyes and waited. It was at times like this that she could feel the instrument alive in her arms, taking slow and measured breaths as it guarded its master. She treasured these moments, when she could be alone in the world with her beloved instrument, wrapped in its protective cocoon.
        \n\n
        Suddenly, the etwahl stiffened. She caressed the smooth curve of metal questioningly. Before she could cull an answer, a husky voice rang out.
        \n\n
        “Sona!”
        \n\n
        Sona’s eyes flew open at the only sound she loved more than music itself. She found herself at the doorstep of a Demacian estate, staring into the open doorway with the same wonder on her face as on the day she was brought to her new home. Lestara Buvelle stood before her, adorned in a handsome velvet robe. Dripping in jewels and her usual heavy perfume, Lestara moved forward, her round face bright with happiness. “My darling, look at you! You are a grown woman now, and you have made much of yourself.”
        \n\n
        Lestara embraced Sona and leaned back to appraise her.
        \n\n
        “Truly, you have made me proud. My heart sings when I look upon you. Come in and sit with me awhile.”
        \n\n
        Lestara turned to walk down the long hallway, her footsteps clicking a staccato rhythm on the tile floor. Sona’s heart swelled with happiness, and she reached for her instrument’s reassuring steel.
        \n\n
        Her hands clutched nothing but air.
        \n\n
        Sona turned, looking for the etwahl. Had she mindlessly placed it aside just now? Suddenly, a chord rang out, piercingly askew. Sona spun around to see the etwahl drifting swiftly down the hallway. Sona called the instrument back to her, but for the first time, it paid no heed. The single note played over and over as it drew closer to Lestara’s back.
        \n\n
        It was out for blood.
        \n\n
        Sona flew frantically into the hallway, but she was too far away to reach Lestara in time. Her only chance was to scream a warning. She strained her throat, but no sound would come forth, just as it never had in her entire life.
        \n\n
        The etwahl’s strings strummed a terrible noise that would forever be embedded in her memory. A vibration trembled through the air, and a rush of razor-thin air scythes tore through Lestara’s body.
        \n\n
        Sona reached Lestara’s side in time to catch her as the body fell to the ground in a pool of blood. Tears streamed down Sona’s face as she tried to scream, but no sound would come out.
        \n\n
        The hallway dissolved into blackness, leaving Sona crumpled around Lestara’s body, with the etwahl lying innocently at her side. Lestara’s eyes rolled open, and she asked weakly, “Why do you want to join the League?”
        \n\n
        Sona’s mind reeled, unable to comprehend what was happening. Suddenly, she felt the tingle of arcane magic in her throat, an overwhelming sensation that brought tears to her eyes. The breath passing in and out of her body tickled inside her, trying to draw sounds out with every exhale. Sona stared incredulously at Lestara, who nodded at her and bade her to speak.
        \n\n
        Opening her mouth, she began to speak for the first time in her life. Her breath caught in her throat, short of uttering her first sound, when a booming voice from the recesses of her dim memory resounded in her mind.
        \n\n
        This instrument will be the key to unlocking the world. It will speak for you more truly than a voice ever could. Nothing else – not us, them, or any magic in this world will ever own you again.
        \n\n
        Almost of its own accord, her hand flung outwards and slammed down on the ethwahl next to her. Dissonance erupted, deafeningly loud, drowning out any sounds that might have spilled forth from her lips. As the tones faded away, so did the foreign tingling in her throat. The enchantment was gone, never to return.
        \n\n
        Lestara’s voice grew loud, booming into the ether. “Why do you want to join the League, Sona?”
        \n\n
        The ethwahl’s strings shivered and began to play on its own, but Sona pressed down with her palm to silence the instrument. It resisted for a tense moment and fell quiet. Slowly, her fingers began to trickle across the strings. Hesitantly at first, testing her instrument’s yield, she played a defiant progression in response to her question.
        \n\n
        “How does it feel, exposing your mind?”
        \n\n
        Her fingers danced across the strings, urging forth a melody of loneliness and isolation. It was the song of those who had lived their lives hidden in plain sight, always passed over despite trying desperately to be noticed. It began pensively, mournfully sad, and gradually grew to a crashing, raging crescendo. The last notes echoed with a tone of quiet acceptance, but above all, catharsis.
        \n\n
        A smile raked across Lestara’s face. “Welcome to the League, Maven of the Strings.” Lestara disappeared, and the darkness fell away to reveal Sona floating in front of ornate double doors. She knew they led to the League of Legends.
        \n\n
        Her ethwahl molded reassuringly to her hands, lying in wait for its master’s command. Sona moved through the doors without a second glance.

    <Story>Soraka, the Starchild of Ionia, was the first of her kind. While there are many who tap into the rich magical energies of Valoran, she was the first to tap into the magic of the cosmos itself - the celestial sea in which it is theorized that Runeterra swims among other like bodies. While Runeterran magicians are limited by the finite (though tremendous) powers of runes, there have always been those who have searched to go further. Reaching beyond the terrestrial firmament of Runeterra, Soraka was capable of invoking the power of the stars, evolving beyond her kin. This power has changed her in fantastical ways - it is for this reason that she became known as the Starchild.\n\nThough Soraka was once trans-human, Soraka has fallen since she let the most primal of emotions rule her. Warwick, a mercenary chemist in the service of Noxus, had caused untold suffering and death among Soraka's people. An alchemical genius who took no responsibility for the atrocities he'd caused, Warwick became known as ''the Deathmaker'' by the Ionian people. As Noxian murder and terror pushed ever-forward across her land, unstoppable anger and hatred welled within Soraka. She called down the power of the heavens to curse and forever change the Deathmaker, and she mutated the man into a werewolf - a wild, murderous beast. For this misstep, Soraka lost much of her power, sacrificing her trans-human ascension and sliding several steps down the evolutionary ladder in an instant. Though she is still a champion of the Ionian people, Soraka has joined the League of Legends in hopes of reversing her curse and redeeming herself in the eyes of the stars.\n\nThough having fallen from grace, Soraka is nonetheless determined to once again be one with the stars.</Story>

    <Story>The earliest account of Swain's existence comes from a Noxian infirmary doctor's notes. According to them, Swain limped into the ward without cry or complaint; his right leg was snapped in half, with bone protruding from the skin. A small, scowling bird seemed affixed to his shoulder. The doctor gawked in horror as the young adolescent answered questions about his health and age with a calm, even stare. Even behind the echoing crack as the sand counterweights reset his tibia, Swain's measuring gaze never flickered, nor did his eyes twitch from the pop of his fibula. He refused the doctor's recommendation of magical treatment for the leg's inoperable damage, requesting only a spare crutch before shuffling away. He next surfaced in documents from the Noxian military, although it is evident that they are incomplete. Normally a crippled boy would be turned away in shame from Noxus' proud legion, but the records indicate his first designation was that of a ranking officer.\n\nThe men who've served under him (and survived) have remained in his charge with unshakable faith and loyalty. He leapt through the High Command's hierarchy, often ascending when superiors requested demotions to join his unit. A cunning strategist, Swain was decorated after every battle he fought, regularly hobbling in contemplation at the front of the assault. His rise to power seemed unceasing until he was suddenly relegated to inactive status prior to the Ionian Invasion - a bewildering decision which reeked of bureaucratic subversion. If Swain was upset by the events which unfolded, he never belied it. His face was so implacable that it was popularly rumored to be a mask, disguising something utterly inhuman beneath. More controversy surrounded the bird that never left his shoulder, whose name he whispered only to it. When Demacia escalated its presence in the League, Swain was immediately returned to active duty.\n\n''If you haven't yet lost the ability to ask, you may not yet ask for relief.''\n-Swain</Story>

        Swain arches his neck toward the words that hang over the massive double doors. “The truest opponent lies within.”
        \n\n
        “How quaint.”
        \n\n
        Swain’s voice sounds surprisingly robust for such a seemingly frail figure. His uniform – more robe than military dress – is wrapped tightly about him, especially around his face. He stands crookedly; he leans on a cane to support himself, but not overly so. It does not seem out of place to see a strange-looking raven perched on his shoulder. Perhaps this is to whom Swain is speaking.
        \n\n
        “Let’s see who the League believes my truest opponent is – shall we?”
        \n\n
        The raven nods its head in affirmation.
        \n\n
        Swain deftly raps on the double doors with the head of his cane. They split, revealing blackness within. The engraved panthers along either side of the double doors point inward.
        \n\n
        There is a slight smirk on his face as he enters.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The ink on the Noxian and Demacian armistice had been but a few years dry before the first “incident” took place between the powerful city-states. It was right in the midst of that botched mission, at the moment of execution, where Swain now found himself at. He could see the platform where the young prince was standing, his back turned, oblivious to his plight. The poison-bolted hexbow felt heavy in Swain’s hands.
        \n\n
        “I am impressed. I didn’t expect it to be so real.”
        \n\n
        He scanned the darkened balcony overlooking where the Demacian royals were standing. The cold night air was brisk. Swain breathed, inhaling deeply. “And accurate. This is nearly intoxicating.”
        \n\n
        “What is, Swine?” A commanding voice mocked the Noxian. Jarvan IV, the Exemplar of Demacia, Crown Prince of the same, now stood on the balcony. His presence lorded over Swain. Jarvan was no longer the thirteen-year old child prince that Swain had been sent to dispatch. “How’s the leg?”
        \n\n
        “You even know about that. Powerful,” Swain commented, raising his cane to his chin, “but alas, not powerful enough for me, summoner. Enough.”
        \n\n
        Jarvan looked stunned, and just a little bit confused.
        \n\n
        “I do not play games – I make them. We are both aware of what I think happened during the mission you’re recreating here. You know how I truly feel about my weaknesses. You clearly know who I am, seeing as how you’re so blatantly ransacking my memories.” Swain happily leered at Jarvan. “Unless I am mistaken, this should satisfy half of your prerequisite needs for a champion’s entry into the League.”
        \n\n
        “It does?” a less-commanding Jarvan asked. His countenance was considerably less Demacian now. He paused for a moment, and then nodded. “Yes, perhaps it does. We acknowledge your power, Swain of Noxus.”
        \n\n
        The Demacian prince was no longer standing before Swain. Where he had stood there was now an older, strikingly beautiful woman in a purple summoner’s robe. The robe was highly ornate, unlike most of the other robes Swain had seen in his time. The female summoner bowed. “We would ask, however, that you please honor the League with a formal acknowledgement.”
        \n\n
        Swain chuckled and nodded. “High Councilor Vessaria Kolminye – I am honored. I was not aware that someone of your stature conducted screenings personally. Is there a chance I could expect you to personally summon me into a battle arena?” Swain was clearly enjoying this exchange.
        \n\n
        “Charming, as always, Master Tactician.” The High Councilor smiled thinly. “Your formal acknowledgement, if you would be so kind.”
        \n\n
        Swain bowed deeply, kicking his cane out with a flourish. “Of course. With all due respect.”
        \n\n
        The Noxian clutched his cane to stand straight. “You would ask of me how it feels to share my mind with a summoner. As you can see, I face little challenge in managing such a relationship. While my secrets are laid bare to the summoner that calls upon me, I know that they would not be used against me by the League. Such a violation of trust is against everything the League stands for... especially in these most tense of times when the League needs the cooperation of its client city-states.”
        \n\n
        High Councilor Kolminye nodded approvingly. “Thank you, and yes – the knowledge exchanged in the bond is private between champion and summoner. You have nothing to fear.”
        \n\n
        “Nor do you.” Swain bowed again, keeping his eyes locked on the High Councilor.
        \n\n
        A tense pause was broken by the High Councilor. “Why do you want to join the League, Jericho Swain?”
        \n\n
        Swain took the question in. The slight smug look that he had worn throughout the entire Judgment was gone. He stared straight into High Councilor Kolminye’s eyes. “To become the next ruler of Noxus, of course.” Swain pointed the head of his cane at the High Councilor. “The League will help me accomplish this.”
        \n\n
        “The League does not arbitrarily choose sides in the matters of the city-states of Valoran, nor does it –”
        \n\n
        Swain put his index finger to his lips. “You know what I mean... don’t you, Vessaria?”
        \n\n
        The High Councilor paused once more. “Yes, I do. But you’ll have to earn the influence you need. It won’t come easily.” The High Councilor permitted herself the slightest of sneers. “Especially for you.” Her eyes were as two red embers, flickering intensely. “But that is not all, is it, Master Tactician?”
        \n\n
        Swain nodded. “Indeed, it is not. Your Judgment... it is quite the ritual. It is more powerful than I had given you credit for.” He leaned in to the High Councilor’s left ear, a breath’s distance away.
        \n\n
        Swain’s voice was soft, but every word hung on the air as he spoke. “I want to kill Jarvan IV, the ‘Exemplar’ of Demacia.” He smiled at the High Councilor, still close to her ear. “I will kill him too, Vessaria.”
        \n\n
        High Councilor Kolminye locked eyes with Swain for one last time. She raised her right hand to his cheek. “We shall see, Jericho.”
        \n\n
        A flood of light washed over them both, and Swain found himself alone in the chamber. A new set of double doors were in front of him, already opened. The League had found its latest champion.

    <Story>
      Born with immense magical potential, Syndra loves nothing more than exercising the incredible power at her command. With each passing day, her mastery of magical force grows more potent and devastating. Refusing any notion of balance or restraint, Syndra wants only to retain control of her power, even if it means annihilating the authorities that seek to stop her.
      \n\n
      Throughout her youth in Ionia, Syndra's reckless use of magic terrified the elders of her village. They took her to a remote temple, leaving her in the care of an old mage. To Syndra's delight, the mage explained that the temple was a school -- a place where she could develop her talents under his guidance. Though she learned much during her time there, Syndra no longer felt her power growing as it had in her youth. Her frustration grew, and she finally confronted her mentor, demanding an explanation. He revealed that he had dampened Syndra's magic, hoping to help her learn control and restraint. Accusing him of betrayal, she advanced on the mage, commanding him to lift the spell that was holding her back. He backed away, telling her that if she couldn't control herself, he would be forced to nullify Syndra's magic completely. Furious, she summoned her power and dashed the old man against the walls. With her mentor dead, Syndra felt the rush of her unbounded potential for the first time in years. Though she had won her freedom, she refused to return to the society that had tried to steal her gift. Instead, Syndra decided to claim her former prison as a stronghold. Pushing the boundaries of her magic, she tore the structure from its foundations and raised it into the sky. Free to delve further into her art, Syndra now aims to grow powerful enough to destroy the weak, foolish leaders of Ionia -- and anyone else who would dare shackle her greatness.

    <Story>Talon's earliest memories are the darkness of Noxus' underground passages and the reassuring steel of a blade. He has no memory of family, warmth, or kindness. Instead, the clink of stolen gold and the security of a wall at his back are all the kinship he has ever craved. Kept alive only by his quick wits and deft thievery, Talon scraped out a living in the seedy underbelly of Noxus. His incredible skills with the blade earned him great notoriety. Various guilds sent assassins against him with a demand: join their ranks or be killed. His response was to leave the bodies of his pursuers stuffed in a dark corner or dumped in Noxus' moat. Having lived on the streets, Talon knew better than to waste - he claimed a blade from every failed attempt on his life, gathering a seemingly endless collection of weaponry.\n\nThe assassination attempts grew increasingly dangerous until one assailant met Talon blade-for-blade in a match of strength. To his astonishment, Talon was disarmed. He was facing down his executioner's sword when the assassin revealed himself to be General Du Couteau. The General offered Talon the standard of life that befitted an agent of the Noxian High Command in exchange for his allegiance. Talon accepted on the condition that his service was to Du Couteau alone, for the only type of orders he could respect were from one he could not defeat. Talon remained in the shadows, carrying out assassinations on Du Couteau's orders until the day that the general disappeared. Talon's suspicions led him to the doors of the Institute of War, where he joined the League of Legends in order to find the parties responsible for Du Couteau's disappearance.\n\n"The three deadliest blademasters in all of Valoran are bound to the house of Du Couteau: my father, myself, and Talon." - Katarina Du Couteau</Story>

    <Judgment date="23 August, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Talon enters the Great Hall with wary anticipation, his gaze forward. The unknowing might consider him careless, but to his perceptive observers it is apparent that Talon is infinitely aware of every detail in his surroundings.
        \n\n
        While his focus is sharp, Talon's mind is elsewhere. He hastens towards the massive double doors at the end of the hall and regards them impassively. His purpose lies far beyond the Reflection Chamber. What lies within is a necessary distraction, but hardly an obstacle. Blade in hand, he enters without pause.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Talon was on the ground, his face pressed to the dirt-ridden cracks between black cobblestones. The world came into focus around him one piece at a time--first the stench of sewage, then the muffled cries of "stop, thief," and finally the walls of the dead-end alleyway, its corners piled high with reeking decay.
        \n\n
        He needed nothing else to identify his location. He knew this alleyway-and the slums of Noxus-all too well.
        \n\n
        Talon rolled onto his hands and knees. His arms and legs, gangly and darkened with dirt, stung and bled from fresh scrapes. The cries grew closer, coming for him. "Find that boy!"
        \n\n
        Talon glanced about, quelling his panic. His eyes fell on what appeared to be a rotten plank of wood, half-covered in garbage and waste, in the shadowed corner of the alley. With what quickness he could muster, Talon scurried towards it, grabbing the rotten plank and tugging it aside. Beneath it, a small opening led under the alley wall and deep into the darkness. In a swift and painful motion, Talon twisted to drop himself down into the opening and slid the plank back into place.
        \n\n
        He pressed his back to a muddy dirt wall as the muted sounds of confusion came from outside his hiding place. He remained perfectly still until his pursuers dispersed, their footsteps retreating and grumbled voices fading.
        \n\n
        Talon tried to catch his breath. The wet air he gasped into his lungs reeked of rats and sewage. As the rush of adrenaline left him, he found himself stricken instead by the dull pain of hunger and, more pointedly, anger.
        \n\n
        "Where was Kavyn" he growled to himself and looked down into the dark.
        \n\n
        The plan had been simple. Their target had been a fruit merchant whose cart stood at the edge of the marketplace. Kavyn was to give the signal and, as Talon took what he could, Kavyn would create a distraction so that he could escape. He'd seen the signal, but moments later, as he filled his satchel with Kumungu berries, he caught the attention of half the marketplace. And worse, he'd lost the bag in his frantic escape through the slums.
        \n\n
        With nothing gained but a painfully hungry stomach, Talon seethed with bitterness.
        \n\n
        Talon turned and began to crawl down the passage. Before long, his fingers and knees squelched as the ground beneath him became wet and cold-he'd reached the old and unused pipe that led into Noxus- underground chambers, most of them connected to the sewer network.
        \n\n
        It isn't the first time that Kavyn has failed me like this, Talon thought as the passage sloped downward. With the pain in his stomach and the weakness in his limbs, he couldn't help but recall instead the times he'd succeeded alone, fending for himself without dependence on anyone else.
        \n\n
        Finally, the pipe opened over a small chamber, its space filled with makeshift furniture and garbage scraps. Far below the western edge of the chamber, where a sheer drop took the place of a wall, a foul river carried Noxian sewage out of the city. Talon twisted within the pipe's cramped space and dropped down.
        \n\n
        "You made it back!"
        \n\n
        Talon whirled. Kavyn stood against the wall below the pipe's mouth, lighting a match. The flickering flame revealed a boy hardly older than Talon himself and just as rough and dirty, his brown hair a matted mess on his head.
        \n\n
        "Where were you?" Talon snarled.
        \n\n
        "Never mind that," Kavyn dropped the lit match onto a small pile of trash beneath him, which instantly caught and cast a wavering light about the chamber. "Did you get anything?"
        \n\n
        "A bag of Kumungu berries," Talon's voice was cold. "I dropped it-while running."
        \n\n
        He saw a twitch of unease in Kavyn's expression, and his eyes flicked to a small and nearly-empty crate in one corner of the chamber, where they usually kept their stores of stolen food. "Oh."
        \n\n
        "Where were you?"
        \n\n
        The other boy held up his hands. "Just hold on," he said. "I've got something." Kavyn tugged at his tattered leather belt, revealing two sheaths at his side that Talon had never seen before. From within them, Kavyn withdrew a pair of short daggers. Their blades shone like gold in the firelight, and Talon's eyes widened.
        \n\n
        "Listen," said Kavyn, tearing Talon's covetous gaze away. "We can sell them. It doesn't matter that you lost the food."
        \n\n
        Talon bristled, but the comment fazed him far less than it should have. He looked back to the daggers, which Kavyn held flat in his palm as though they'd slice him open if he wiggled a finger.
        \n\n
        "I stole them from a drunk near the market tavern," Kavyn explained. "That's where I went. I thought--well, we'll make enough to eat for a few days with these, right? And..."
        \n\n
        He continued to explain himself, but Talon no longer heard him. He reached a hand forward for one of the blades. As he held it, Talon became immediately aware of its shoddy quality, its weight imbalance, the way the hilt splintered. It was hardly suited for cutting meat, let alone use in combat. The blade had three worn notches and Talon ran his finger gently against them, just enough to feel its sharpness--one, two, three. He was possessed by the feel of it in his hand. The blade empowered him.
        \n\n
        Kavyn had stopped talking and turned to pull the remaining potatoes from their crate. I was nearly caught because of this foolish boy, Talon thought, the bitter, hateful fire lit again within him. He knew he'd have inevitably been killed, for such is the Noxian way.
        \n\n
        Talon ran his fingers along the blade's notches again. The Noxian way... he'd heard that before, in whispers on the streets. The strongest find their way out of the gutter. Weapons were coveted things, weapons--even a simple pair of daggers--were the key to survival. Another whisper, one he'd heard again and again, echoed in his mind: The strong rely on no one but themselves.
        \n\n
        Talon clenched the blade in his fist and dashed forward, reaching to put the dagger to Kavyn's throat...
        \n\n
        ...but the boy whirled around and caught Talon's wrist, blocking his attack. Talon stood shocked. This is wrong, he thought. He remembered the blood on his hands, he remembered dropping the body into the sewer--the first of many.
        \n\n
        Kavyn spoke, but the voice was not his own: "Why do you want to join the League, Talon?"
        \n\n
        "For General Du Couteau," Talon said. The sewer chamber began to fade to darkness around them. Talon felt the weight of his bladed cloak returning to his shoulders, the illusion shattered. "My search has led me here."
        \n\n
        "You fight for yourself," said the summoner imitating Kavyn's form. "You have no allies. You kill to survive, yet you follow at this vanished General's heels like a dog on a leash. Why?"
        \n\n
        Talon tried to wrench his arm away, yet he found himself paralyzed not by the summoner's physical strength but by some magical intervention. "I am in his debt. The General spared my life?"
        \n\n
        "Is your debt not paid? After you spilled the blood of the boy called Kavyn, you swore allegiance to no one. You killed without remorse, and while you killed for Du Couteau until the day he vanished, you may now have freedom if you wish it. Why do you want to join the League, Talon?"
        \n\n
        "You misunderstand," Talon hissed. "In the slums of Noxus I killed to survive. Under Du Couteau I killed in his name, but my life was my own. Now--I am nothing, yet I still have my blades. What other purpose can my blades serve?"
        \n\n
        "How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        The summoner released him. Talon grasped his cloak and vanished into the dark, leaving the Reflecting Chamber in utter silence. The summoner glanced back and forth, scowling, and stiffened when Talon's blade appeared at his throat.
        \n\n
        "Unpleasant," Talon growled into his ear. "Necessary."
        \n\n
        And he was gone.

  <Champion name="Taric" title="The Gem Knight" range="125" gender="m" rp="585" ip="1350" abilityVideoID="0044">
    <Story>There is a form of magic unknown to many Runeterrans and discredited by the few who are even aware of its existence. It is the magic of the earth, drawing power from the resonance of crystals and gems. Taric, the Gem Knight, is Runeterra's sole practitioner of this form of magic, having been erratically summoned to Runeterra from a faraway world. Back home, Taric's father was a distinguished healer in their home city. Taric was always interested in his father's pursuits, even from a young age. Despite his burgeoning understanding of herbs, plants, and animal medicines, it was the power of gems that most fascinated the growing boy. It wasn't long before Taric had exhausted his father's coveted library and set out on a path of his own. He wanted to help the people, but not by simply salving their wounds and curing their woes. He wasn't to be a healer, but a defender - one who used the power of earth to preserve and protect.\n\nTaric became a wandering knight, renowned across his homeland as a guardian of the just until the day a spell of summoning grabbed him from his home and deposited him on Runeterra. Though disoriented and confused at first, he now feels that the continent of Valoran is in need of someone like him. Despite missing his homeland, Taric is happy to fight in the League, serving as a protector for all who seek one. His neat and stylish appearance combined with his shiny bejeweled armor and weapons have rapidly made him a celebrity champion of the League of Legends. Valoran's media, for some reason, has taken great interested in his personal life. While open about his life as a champion and gracious in all things, Taric is tight-lipped about his life outside the League and prefers his privacy.\n\nAs Taric's father taught him, every stone has its meaning. For Taric's enemies, they all mean trouble.</Story>

  <Champion name="Teemo" title="The Swift Scout" range="500" gender="m" rp="585" ip="1350" spotlight="Qj48qHM1MXE" abilityVideoID="0017">
    <Story>Teemo is a legend among his yordle brothers and sisters in Bandle City. As far as yordles are concerned, there is something just slightly off about him. While Teemo enjoys the companionship of other yordles, he also insists on frequent solo missions in the ongoing defense of Bandle City. Despite his genuinely warm personality, something switches off inside Teemo's mind during combat so that the lives he must end while on patrol do not burden him. Even as a young recruit, the drill instructors and other trainees found it a little disconcerting that, while Teemo was normally charming and kind, he turned deadly serious and highly efficient the minute combat exercises began. Teemo's superiors quickly steered him toward the Scouts of the Mothership, which is one of Bandle City's most distinguished Special Forces unit alongside the Megling Commandos.\n\nWhile most yordles do not handle solo scouting missions with a great deal of finesse, Teemo is remarkably efficient at them. His record of success in defending Bandle City from infiltrators easily makes him one of the most dangerous yordles alive, though you'd never know it by having a cup of honey mead with him at his favorite inn. Bandle City chose Teemo as their first champion for the League, and he has taken to it like a duck to water. His signature weapon - a blowgun - uses a rare ajunta poison he personally gathers from the jungles of Kumungu. To help cope with his lengthy periods of isolation, Teemo recently struck up a friendship with Tristana, a fellow League champion and fellow member of Bandle City's Special Forces. This connection is healthy for both yordles, though now Valoran's voracious media outlets circulate rumors that the friendship is turning into a romantic relationship. Regardless, Teemo is a crowd favorite in the League of Legends, and a pint-sized foe that many have come to fear.\n\n''Teemo rides a thin line between chipper compatriot and unrepentant killer, but there's no one else I'd rather have as a friend.'' -Tristana</Story>

  <Champion name="Tristana" title="The Megling Gunner" range="550" gender="f" rp="585" ip="1350" abilityVideoID="0018">
    <Story>The Megling Commandos are something of a legend in Bandle City. They have a history that spans centuries, and they remain the oldest yordle military unit still in service. They are renowned for their courage, deadliness, and ruthlessness, making them the most respected and feared of all warriors in Bandle City. Legends of Megling, the valiant founder of the commandos, are still heard throughout Valoran's taverns. It was these legends that most fascinated a young Tristana. Since she was a wee child, Tristana wanted nothing more than to become the crack shot that her idol had been all those years ago. She trained her entire life, until finally she was old enough to join the military and able to earn her place among the Megling Commandos. The senior officers were impressed by her abilities, claiming that Tristana was a natural, and her dream was realized the day she donned her Megling fatigues.\n\nThough her heart lies with her unit, the call to the League of Legends was irresistible and now Tristana protects Bandle City as a champion. While intense and focused as a Megling Gunner, Tristana is remarkably different in her personal life. Outside the Fields of Justice, she is friendly and cheerful - the sort of yordle who always has a kind word for everyone. Tristana recently struck up a close friendship with Teemo, the Swift Scout. They are both members of Bandle City's Special Forces, so not only do they bond as yordles, but also as fellow warriors and champions... though she outright ignores any questions pertaining to a blossoming romance.\n\n''If there's one person I'd trust to take on a difficult mission, it's Tristana - all day long!'' - Teemo</Story>

    <Story>Trolls have never been well-regarded beings of Valoran. Generally speaking, they are barbaric, cannibalistic, and sneaky. They are creatures relegated to the murky recesses of the world, hidden away from most intelligent beings. Despite their maleficent natures, however, the Ruhgosk never deserved the grisly fate that was visited upon them. Generations ago, a twisted necromancer known as Hakolin the Bonecrafter attempted to enslave the Ruhgosk tribe. These trolls are considerably more genteel than their ill-mannered brethren, although still uncouth by human standards. The Ruhgosk fought tooth and claw against the necromancer, ultimately driving him from their land. As a parting gift, Hakolin afflicted the trolls with a leprous disease, forever cursing the members of the tribe. The leprosy would have rotted their flesh away to nothing were it not for the trolls' natural ability to regenerate. Caught forever in a hideous rotting state, the Ruhgosk endured their curse while desperately in search of a cure. They never found one.\n\nA wise Ruhgosk shaman learned that he could magically bind the disease to a single troll, provided that the troll could bear the weight of the entire tribe's curse upon himself. However, there was no such troll...until the birth of Trundle. His ability to regenerate was so profound that it appeared as if he did not carry the disease. As Trundle grew, he came to understand his gift and what it could do for his people. When he came of age, he took the curse from his tribe in a baptism of searing agony. Through the shaman's ritual, Trundle became a horrifying creature whose flesh constantly sloughs off his body, only to be re-grown in an unremitting cycle. He has joined the League of Legends in hopes of eventually finding someone who could dispel the heinous curse completely.\n\n''I've learned a thing or two about pain! Let me show you.''\n\n      - Trundle</Story>

    <Judgment date="26 November, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        A distinctly foul odor permeating the air announces the troll's arrival. The sounds of scraping nails, labored breathing, and dirty feet scrabbling across the pristine marble floors reach the Great Hall before Trundle does. He is frighteningly out of place in the halls of the Institute of War, surrounded by gleaming decor while barely discernable rags hang off his body in some semblance of modesty. He shifts his grip on a makeshift club, an unwieldy weapon that is as long as his entire body. His skin bubbles with sores and scars, sloughing off in chunks from his body. It is amazing that he still has any flesh at all.
        \n\n
        Trundle's weary eyes pass over the Great Hall - he lingers not on the inscription above the door, or the fine statues representing Valoran's greatest craftsmanship. These material objects mean nothing to him. A mangled tongue flicks over his unshapely lips, and he reaches out to open the doors leading to the Reflecting Chamber. As if the doors themselves are afraid to come under his touch, they part before him. He shrugs, apparently used to this type of behavior, and slips inside.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Trundle's eyes flew open as something sharp pricked his hand. He was surprised to find himself strapped down to a makeshift altar, surrounded by a circle of runes. The shamans of his tribe stood hunched over him, ready to begin the ceremony that would change his life forever.
        \n\n
        This time, he felt a distinct detachment from the entire scene - a far cry from the raging wave of excitement, fear, and pride that had consumed him the first time it happened. He had been so young then, freshly wounded from the daily ritual of being bullied by the younger trolls. Looking back at his former self, he almost couldn't blame them - he had always been funny-looking, even by troll standards, and being the runt of the entire tribe didn't help the situation. Had any other smaller or uglier troll been born into the tribe, Trundle was sure that he would have redirected the bullying to the new target, and happily joined in himself.
        \n\n
        What he distinctly remembered was the elders' whispered promises - that if he were to bear the weight of the entire tribe's curse onto himself, it would be the noblest sacrifice in the entire history of their race. They told him that he was the only one who could save them all when they beheld the innate regeneration that only he was born with. The young Trundle had gotten carried away with what they told him - he fantasized about the admiration in the eyes of those who had once ridiculed him, the adoration of his entire tribe, and the riches and comfort he would enjoy as they lauded his sacrifice.
        \n\n
        Most importantly of all, he saw his life without all the bullying.
        \n\n
        So he gave himself to the disease, letting it ravage his body. In many ways, it was a success - the Ruhgosks rejoiced in their newfound freedom and lavished their adoration on Trundle. But it was not to last – before long, his kin began to keep their distance from him. Seeing his open sores and diseased flesh was apparently too much for even trolls to handle, despite having been similarly afflicted mere weeks earlier.
        \n\n
        It was during these times that he sometimes thought that being bullied was better than being alone. At least people could stand to be around him, even if it was just to make fun of him. Someone spoke, snapping him out of his reverie. "Why do you want to join the League?" Trundle turned, sitting up on the altar as the straps pinning him down disappeared. A summoner swathed in a blue robe stood behind him, towering over the troll. His face was hidden within the recesses of his cowl.
        \n\n
        "To search for a cure for this disease," Trundle intoned wearily.
        \n\n
        "And what if I told you that I already have your cure?"
        \n\n
        "You're a dirty liar!"
        \n\n
        "I've studied you, Trundle. The League knows everything about our candidates before they even pass through our doors. Your disease eats you alive, but your incredible regenerative power prevents your disease from spreading to your tribe again."
        \n\n
        Trundle snorted. "Tell me something new. Any idiot can see the flesh tumbling from my bones and smell the stink of rot. I may be a troll, but I'm not stupid."
        \n\n
        "True, but what you don't know, Trundle, is that you bearing the disease of your brethren will also be their downfall. While the plague that your tribe bore was debilitating, eventually their bodies came to rely on the disease. Yes, it caused them immense pain and constant disease, but it became inextricably fused with your race's inherent ability to regenerate." The summoner's tone was clinical as he spoke. "Thus, when the plague was extracted from their bodies, it took along with it their regenerative capabilities. Now their bodies do not even know how to sustain themselves."
        \n\n
        The summoner paused. "What they did to you did not cure them. It barely even prolongs the tribe's inevitable extinction."
        \n\n
        Trundle closed his eyes, overwhelmed.
        \n\n
        The summoner continued on, unrelenting. "So, I ask you, Trundle of the Ruhgosk tribe, do you want the League to restore the disease to your tribe?"
        \n\n
        The images flashed unbidden before his eyes - his tribe once again plagued by the debiliating disease, all equally humbled by their affliction. He imagined telling them how this sacrifice saved them all from a potentially worse fate, and his tribe finally seeing him for the savior that he was.
        \n\n
        And suddenly, the sting of naiveté that caused him to make this same choice before shattered his train of thought. His decision to bear the burden of disease never changed the fact that he was the runt. Nothing he ever did would change that.
        \n\n
        A crooked smile snaked across his misshapen face. "Let them suffer. I'll keep what they so generously gave me."
        \n\n
        "So it shall be. Then I will ask you again – why do you want to join the League, if not for a cure?" "It seems this is the 'cure' I was looking for after all."
        \n\n
        "How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        Trundle thought for a long moment. "For once, it felt like I wasn’t alone anymore. Thank you for that."
        \n\n
        The summoner nodded and disappeared. Trundle stood alone in a long corridor, with a trail of dirt and peeled skin marking the way he had entered. He shrugged, triggering another avalanche of shed flesh, and strode forward into the League of Legends.

    <Story>There are those who choose not to live in one of the great city-states of Valoran. Instead, they live in remote locales, often as part of a nomad or barbarian tribe. While perils abound in these untamed lands, there is also great freedom in being removed from the politics of Valoran. Tryndamere was born a member of one of these barbarian tribes in northern Valoran. Even as a young boy, it was obvious that he would grow in martial prowess to become one of his clan's greatest warriors. However, as his clan moved south between the Howling Marsh and the Ironspike Mountains, they came across strangers in black garb, brandishing symbols of a beast's skull. Despite Tryndamere's pleas, his elder went out to speak with the strangers; they cut him down mercilessly. From there, they began to slaughter every man, woman, and child in the clan. Tryndamere, the sole survivor, hid under the bodies of his dead parents. Upon their bloodied corpses, he swore eternal vengeance on those who took his people from him - the assassins of Noxus.\n\nTo train himself, Tryndamere voluntarily served under all the great chieftains of the barbarian tribes, learning the ways of the barbarian warrior. Not only did this make him the man he needed to become in order to exact his revenge, it has also garnered him friends and allies among the most powerful barbarian leaders of Valoran. This recently allowed him to unite the barbarians into a single, powerful force - all under his command. Now he has joined the League of Legends to earn enough influence to find a permanent home for his people... and to slake his rage on the champions of his hated foes.\n\n''The next true power will come from the far north, and it will involve Tryndamere - one way or another.'' -Graccus Mightstone, League Senior Political Scholar.</Story>

    <Story>Although born to poor gypsy parents, the champion known as Twisted Fate was able to gamble his way to prosperity as a card shark in the seedy underground gambling circuits of Demacia and Noxus.  No matter how close the authorities came to catching him, the rogue always found a way to slip through their fingers.  Despite his good fortune, he was never able to win that which he truly desired - the ability to control magic.  When Twisted Fate learned of an experiment being conducted in Zaun that might help him with his wish, he did the only thing a gambler of his worth could do - he went all in and volunteered for the experiment.\n\nConducted by the infamous Dr. Xavier Rath, Twisted Fate was told that the wager for such participation might be steep.  He might change forever, or nothing might happen, or he might die horribly.  Pain, however, was likely a part of the deal no matter the outcome. These were hardly the worst odds the gambler had faced; his hopes raised, Twisted Fate underwent the experiment, enduring what he must for a chance at his dream.  Then, it ended - with seemingly no effect whatsoever.  The gypsy rogue flew into a murderous rage, but, before he could strike down the team, he suddenly teleported himself miles away.  With a sly grin, he realized his luck had won out yet again. He now brings his luck and rakish charm to the Institute of War, where he is the Champion of choice for many - especially the gambling kind.  To this day, Twisted Fate has avoided his inevitable reunion with Dr. Rath.  The Card Master knows, however, that a confrontation is coming.\n\nWhile the future may be mysterious and unknown to most, Twisted Fate is certain that his future lies within the cards.</Story>

    <Story>The city-state of Zaun is a twisted realm of science, mercantilism, and magic run amok.  While the young science of techmaturgy does much to advance civilization, its research and use in Zaun pushes the boundaries of morality on a daily basis.  Zaun, choked with pollution from the countless factories and laboratories that spew waste into the environment, suffers greatly.  As polluted as Zaun is above-ground, its subterranean levels are far worse.  All of Zaun's runoff waste pooled together in its sewers, mixing into a toxic and mysterious concoction.  A single plague rat rose from this alchemical nightmare - Twitch.  Unlike his lesser evolved cousins, Twitch became as sentient as anyone else... provided they were as insane as he.  A seeming byproduct of the evolutionary brew that spawned him was maniacal insanity, albeit in a functional form.\n\nTwitch came to the League of Legends to represent himself ''as the only one of his kind'' on the Fields of Justice.  Since then, he has found a generous benefactor in the city that gave him his evolutionary sentience - Zaun.  Twitch is one of Zaun's premier champions in the League, and as such he fights for Zaun when political disputes between Valoran's city-states arise.  Twitch has publically stated that his goal is to gain enough influence and materiel from his work in the League to try to recreate the process by which he gained his sentience.  While many challenges lie ahead in his quest - one of the largest being his own insanity - were he to succeed, it would mean a bold and brazen step forward in the evolution of all of Runeterra.  Zaun has pledged its support for Twitch in his quest, though it remains to be seen what Zaun's ulterior motives are in the matter.\n\n''The existence of Twitch proves that anything is possible on Runeterra.'' \n-- Heimerdinger\n</Story>

    <Story>The mystics of Ionia delve into the deepest mysteries of Valoran, pioneering the most inner depths of spirituality.  Their adepts are some of the most devout proponents of enlightenment and harmony...but as is always the case, there are those who follow a very different path.  Born in a grassy clearing under a red moon, Udyr has always been compelled by the primal drive within him.  His will was not untempered, simply undomesticated.  As a boy, he toiled on his father's farm, but he felt a much deeper connection with the mustangs that would graze in the distant fields than with the townsfolk who would visit.  Oftentimes he was dragged into the house at night with a swat and a scolding when his parents would find him sleeping beneath the stars.\n\nOn the day of his sixteenth birthday, Udyr bade his family farewell and struck a path to the east, determined to shed the trappings of ''civilized'' society.  Freed of the shackles of cultural expectations, Udyr tapped into a well of inner ferocity he hadn't known before.  His feral senses roiled to the surface and he let them overcome him.  It was at this point in his life that Udyr truly lost his humanity.  Poachers and travelers who entered his territory did so at terrible risk, and rarely managed to leave it.\n\nA monk on a long journey passed through his woods one day, and Udyr decided to scare him, leaping from a nearby brush.  The monk casually turned and redirected Udyr to one side.  Udyr, enraged, tried time and time again to best him, but the monk was unassailable.  When Udyr was exhausted, the monk wordlessly beckoned him to follow, and together they walked in silence to the Hirana Monastery.  The monks there took him in, and taught him to harness and control his animalistic fury...most of the time.</Story>

    <Story>There are warriors who become great for their strength, cunning, or skill with arms.  Others simply refuse to die.  Urgot, once a great soldier of Noxus, may constitute a case in support of the latter.  Prone to diving headlong into enemy battle lines, Urgot sewed chaos throughout the enemy ranks, often sustaining grievous injuries in the process. When his body was unable to weather further abuse, the crippled Urgot was delegated the position of High Executioner of Noxus.  By this time, his hands had been ruined and he could barely walk.  Scythe-like grafts affixed to his maimed limbs served to carry out his bloody work.\n\nUrgot finally met his end at what should have been his finest hour.  Because of his military background, he often accompanied detachments into foreign territory to carry out judgment.  After ambushing an enemy force, Jarvan IV, Crown Prince of Demacia, fell into the clutches of Urgot's division.  Too far from Noxus to risk transporting their prize for ransom, Urgot prepared to dispose of their captive.  At the final moment, however, the Dauntless Vanguard, led by Garen, the Might of Demacia, intervened, and Urgot was cut in two by the zealous warrior as he scrambled to free his Prince.  In recognition of his service, the executioner's remains were remanded to the Bleak Academy for reanimation.  A lifetime of abuse, however, had left his body in a catastrophic state; proving problematic to the necromancers' craft.  Professor Stanwick Pididly, the prevailing scholar of Zaun, offered a solution.  Within Pididly's laboratories, a nightmarish new body was forged for Urgot.  Now as much machine as man, Urgot arrived at the League of Legends in search of the man who ended his life; necromantic energies coursing through his metal veins.\n\n''We can rebuild him. We have the techmaturgy.'' --Professor Stanwick Pididly</Story>

    <Judgment date="24 August, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Urgot shambles along the great hall of the Institute of War, spider-like legs ferrying his bloated, bulbous body towards his ultimate goal. The scrape of metal against marble and the dull crackle of energy mark his passage as he moves with deceptive agility. His horrid emotionless visage belies the conviction in his gaze.
        \n\n
        From his right arm swings a wicked-looking blade, beginning where the hand should have been. His left arm terminates in a cannon, a similarly poor replacement for the extremity. He creaks to a halt before a pair of ornate marble doors. He lifts one of his segmented metal legs, extending it forward to deal with the blocking portal, which slides open easily at his touch. His scarred, patchwork skin - blanched in the eerie glow of the techmaturgical engine that sustains him - glistens with beads of sweat as he scuttles inside.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The darkness around him grew heavy and familiar. He could feel the dew on his scalp as a stiff breeze crossed over him. His whole body trembled, but there was no fear in it. Only the anticipation of what was to come. Urgot wrung his fingers around the shaft of his axe. His fingers! He lifted a hand in front of his face. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he stared in disbelief at the sight of his own, unspoiled digits. Just beyond them he recognized the dour face of Sion, his commanding officer, a whistle pinched between his lips.
        \n\n
        An arc of lightning lit the sky, its brilliance revealing a distant silhouette. Thunder followed a few seconds later. Could it be? Could he be here, now?
        \n\n
        The shrill squeal of his commander's whistle wrenched him from his contemplations. Almost involuntarily, he broke into a charge, dashing headlong towards his distant adversary.
        \n\n
        "Gatecrashers!" he heard someone cry. "Form up, men!"
        \n\n
        Ahead, he could see the soldiers forming ranks, a wall of Demacian shields waiting to meet the charge. Something was wrong. There were too many.
        \n\n
        Without breaking stride be brought his greataxe around, sundering the lead enemy's shield and toppling him backward. Urgot waded in - oblivious to the danger - swinging the weapon in wide arcs to broaden the hole in his enemy's defenses. The sounds of combat filled the air as chaos erupted about him. For an instant, the Demacians were staggered, offering him a moment's reprieve.
        \n\n
        A fresh wound leaked blood into his eyes, and he smeared it away as he peered through the havoc. Another bolt of lightning revealed a resolute, armored form to the rear of the vanguard who was shouting orders while steadying himself against an ancient oak. Urgot began moving once more, battleaxe leading the way.
        \n\n
        He hacked his way to the back of the enemy force, the cries of his fellows lending urgency to his attack. The Demacians were rallying. His comrades were being overwhelmed. He lunged forward to intercept the enemy commander, axe held high, as he moved to rejoin the fray.
        \n\n
        His opponent darted to the side and the axeblade bit firmly into the trunk of the tree. Urgot wrenched wildly, struggling to free the stubborn weapon. But it was too late. There was a flash of silver, and everything fell silent. His vision blurred as he stumbled backward, arms extended before him. The ruined appendages - ending just below the wrist - burned white hot agony as they issued forth a torrent of gore.
        \n\n
        "Do you remember, Urgot?" asked a familiar voice. Urgot turned to face who addressed him. The carnage around him had vanished, and it was daybreak now. He was standing at a clearing in the woods. He could hear the birds chirping in the brisk morning air. Garen, the Might of Demacia, stood a few paces away, idly wiping the blood from his sword.
        \n\n
        "I remember, Demacian," croaked the maimed warrior, stoically, "I remember what you have done to me."
        \n\n
        A wicked smile curled at the edge of Garen's lips. "It is not over," he mocked.
        \n\n
        In the blink of an eye he was gone, replaced by a cheering crowd of Noxian warriors. Urgot's mutilated right arm now ended in a vicious looking glaive, a gift from a field surgeon. He looked down. At his feet, bound prostrate in the dirt, was a handsome, blonde haired youth. Jarvan IV, the Crown Prince of Demacia stared up at him, piercing blue eyes locked on his executioner without fear. Though he was defeated, the air of pride and dignity about him could not be tempered.
        \n\n
        Urgot wore a self-satisfied grin as he raised his arm to strike the fatal stroke. An arrow caught him in the chest, staying his hand. He gasped in pain, looking up just in time to catch a glimpse of that same armored figure closing in on him with uncanny speed, weapon raised menacingly.
        \n\n
        He plummeted to the earth, a warm puddle spreading rapidly beneath him with each slow, deafening beat of his heart. He felt to scream, but could not find his breath. This could not be the end! Not like this! This was his moment. Not like this! Blackness closed in around him, leaving him alone with his killer.
        \n\n
        "Why do you want to join the League, Urgot?" asked Garen, leaning heavily on his sword.
        \n\n
        Urgot's labored gasps ceased. He was whole once more, his metal legs creaking as he quivered with rage. Necromantic energy raced along his metallic spine. "Revenge!" he roared, eyes ablaze with hatred.
        \n\n
        Garen nodded, taking a step closer. "How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        In response, Urgot raised his mighty glaive over his head and brought it down furiously on the image of his nemesis. He found only the open air as the phantom dissolved into the dark. The great doors before him flew open. The League was waiting.

    <Story>
      For his incomparable skill with the bow and his unquestioned sense of honor, Varus was chosen to be the warden of a sacred Ionian temple. The temple was built to contain an ancient pit of corruption so vile that Ionian Elders feared it could envelop the island in darkness. Varus prided himself on his position, as only the most exceptional Ionian warriors were selected for the role. He lived with his family in a nearby village and led a quiet life of disciplined routine until the day the forces of Noxus invaded Ionia. Their shock troops left nothing but death and desolation in their wake, and the temple lay in their path. Varus was forced to make a decision. He was bound by honor to stay and defend the temple, but without him the village's few inhabitants could offer little resistance against the oncoming war machine. Gravely, he chose to fulfill his duty as a warden. The corruption could not be allowed to escape.
      \n\n
      His arrows sundered the troops who tried to wrest the temple from him that day. However, when he returned to his village, he found that it had been reduced to a smoldering graveyard. Remorse at the sight of his slain family gave way to overwhelming regret and then to seething hatred. He swore to slaughter every Noxian invader, but first he needed to become stronger. He turned to that which he had sacrificed everything to protect. The pit of corruption would consume him wholly, as a flame devours a wick, but its abominable power would burn within him until he was lost. This was a path from which there could be no return. With grim resolve, he condemned himself to the black flames, feeling malevolent energy bond to his skin... and with it, the promise of ruin. He left, seeking the blood of all Noxians involved with the invasion, a grisly task that eventually led him to the invasion's most infamous perpetrators in the League of Legends.

      <Observation>
        He absorbs his bow, lest he be tempted to use it in the Institute Of War; it slithers into his palm to rest. The polish of the chamber is immaculate, so that in its ornamental shields and blades his form can be seen reflected; "his" form, though he can never recognize it as his own. His arms disappear into black gauntlets of a liquid that can’t entirely decide on a shape; brackish muck creeps from his toes nearly to his navel, scabbing over into plates.
        \n\n
        What might seem purely black is, upon closer inspection, almost infinitely complex in color; it travels his surface like an oil. Varus wonders if it might have claimed more since yesterday, lapping as it does at what pure flesh remains. He decides that he is, on the whole, satisfied with their arrangement - even if mirrors show him a creature like this.
        \n\n
        "I am not broken," he tells himself. "Not broken. I simply have a different shape."

        Showing Theshan where to hold the bow, how to draw, and how to remember his breath gave Varus a better understanding of these things himself. His son would need to know these things for himself; his father had been anointed Temple Guardian, after all. He wouldn't always be there.
        \n\n
        Varus wasn't there now, strictly speaking; none of this was real, and his clever eyes knew it.
        \n\n
        This was some game Summoners played to amuse themselves with aspirants to the League. But here was his son, blessedly alive. He tousled the boy's warm hair. Varus knew what was coming, and he took such blessings where he could. The two of them looked up the hill, up, until they saw the Temple itself.
        \n\n
        It was older than the village, much older. A statement from a bygone era of plenty, there was no pragmatism in its construction.
        \n\n
        "A Pit of Pallas," said the son who was not his son. "There is a Pit of Pallas there."
        \n\n
        "I did not know it at the time, but yes," replied Varus.
        \n\n
        "They left a single man in its defense?"
        \n\n
        "They did."
        \n\n
        Much surprised him about his new role. The old prayers he'd said every day since he was a boy, it seemed, were missing a few grave syllables; the Elders had been holding out.
        Tattoos of the clever Owl, applied to the face, chest, and arms had altered his perception; this too was surprising. Then, there was The Pit. Round, and just five feet across, it was hard to imagine that this featureless disc could be the source of so much concern.
        \n\n
        He was most surprised, perhaps, when - on his first night's vigil - it began to speak.
        \n\n
        Not with words, no - words would have been much easier to deflect. It spoke in moments, mostly: images, sensations. It knew of people, it could taste them on the air. It knew that they had a hive at the base of its hill, where they writhed in their nonsense bodies. Varus could sense its confusion, and something like hurt; the isolation of the temple had accrued in it. It wanted to show him something he would like. It wanted to make something for him. Its urge was to please.
        \n\n
        This was not the "implacable beast" he had been sworn to contain.
        \n\n
        Once, as Varus entered the sanctum to perform the morning's Rite of Sealing, he was made to see himself, surrounded by others of his village, standing with a young man's vigor while those around him
        withered like crops, their skins falling off like sacks. He could sense that it seemed somehow pleased with itself.
        \n\n
        "Now?" it offered, confident in the reply.
        \n\n
        "No," replied Varus.
        \n\n
        When it spoke next, he ceased to exist in the present altogether. Instead he waded through ankle-high blood, the ripples he made growing and rising until they roared and crashed. He heard a voice, then, or the idea of a voice, which said, pleadingly, "Now?"
        \n\n
        The bite of the incense, with its teeth of rosemary and oak, cut through the vision. He fell back on the palms of his hands, turning and scrambling to load the brazier. It tipped on its copper chain, spilling and searing his hands.
        \n\n
        "NOW?"
        \n\n
        It crashed against his mind, but the Owl asserted itself. It gave him will enough to pull himself along the mazelike walls to the doorway, where he could see the village burning; again, he had to see it all again.
        \n\n
        He ran, though he didn’t entirely know why; there was a part of him that thought if he took this path, slid down this face instead of that, maybe it would be different. Perhaps he would not find his broken wife alongside his broken boy alongside his broken bow; perhaps he would not pick up that bow and bring it back to the Temple.
        \n\n
        He was wrong.
        \n\n
        He was given a vision then of a thousand, thousand dead. It was a wedge pounded through his ribs and into his heart. He fell to his knees.
        \n\n
        "Now?" It was almost a whisper.
        \n\n
        "Now," Varus whispered back. "Now, **** you."
        \n\n
        And when he did so it broke a dam deep in the earth, so that the placid disc of the pool reached up from its heart and splashed out, leaving jags of hot black glass standing wherever it touched. It was flowing through the air, around the curling smoke until it struck Varus off his feet. It peeled his hand, digesting it, consuming the bow. It ate both arms, and both legs, stopping out of... respect, if respect it may be called, for the Owl; it would not surpass the markings. In a moment of detached madness, Varus wondered how long that would last.
        \n\n
        The Reflection wavered, and a summoner panted with exertion; the images wrested themselves from their bindings, careening through a nightmarish series of scenes with an animal immediacy. The room solidified, rendered overbright by the alien senses which collected the last few years of Varus’ grim past:
        \n\n
        Only the tips of each of his toes touched the ground; Varus knew the force couldn't be far. When he overtook them, the cart at the head of the column had the wisdom to encourage its horses. Those without wisdom, or those cursed by circumstance, began to die with terrible speed.
        \n\n
        As Varus slowed, an apparatus with a bow's purpose, if not its shape, leapt to life for the first time at his wrist. He needed not be instructed in its use; a man was instantly pierced, burst like a wineskin. This proved a true inspiration to his fellows, who found within themselves a speed they never knew possible; though even at this speed, they were still beings of flesh and blood. Insufficient.
        \n\n
        Though what it fired wasn’t an arrow, it behaved as one; it ruined as one, travelled through the Noxian insignia, out of one gasping soldier and into another, exploding with six thirsting tongues that gripped and snared. With every death Varus shot faster, until by the end there was no sense that each shot was discrete. The Prey simply ran until it fell. It was elegant horror.
        \n\n
        Time passed quickly. There were more hunts, and more blood; mercies were promised, but withheld. Darkness swirled with the scent of wet leaves, oddly sweet, the broken bodies of men and women rendered wholly abstract in the course of their annihilation. Varus knelt over a sundered cart to seize a communique, pierced through by one of his sharp tendrils; it revealed the names of yet a few more Noxian dogs, responsible for issuing the order...
        \n\n
        The ****ing order. What they took from him he would repay a thousand-fold.
        \n\n
        A summoner stepped forward, her mask of judgment impassive, her presence sweeping away the last threads of the vision. "Your purpose here is clear. You have discerned that among our Champions there exist Noxian agents. This, all of this," she waved her hand, "is the prosecution of some vendetta."
        \n\n
        "You understand, of course, that your vengeance is not the purpose of this League?" she said, eyes narrowed.
        \n\n
        "By now, you surely realize," said Varus, or the amalgam which stood before them cloaked in Varus, its tongue swollen and black.
        \n\n
        "It is the only purpose I have left."

    <Story>The world is not always as civilized as people might think. There are still those who would follow the blackest paths of magic and become corrupted by the darker powers that flow through Runeterra. Shauna Vayne knows this fact well. As a young privileged girl in the heart of Demacia's elite, her father tried to convince her of the constabulary's ever-vigilant eye. Young and naive, she truly believed that her world was one of perfect safety, until one night, when a twisted witch took interest in her father. The malevolent woman overcame her father's conciliar guard, then tortured her family before murdering them. The young Shauna escaped only by hiding herself and then fleeing once the hag had departed, plagued by the screams of her loved ones as she ran. A burning hatred was born in her that day, one that could never be denied.\n\nVayne was able to take care of herself using her father's money, and she began to train as soon as an instructor would have her as a student. By the time she was a fully grown woman, she had become a grim warrior. However, the fields of battle were not to be her home. Demacia needed a protector, one who hunted those lost to the darkness. Shauna used her family's contacts to become the first Night Hunter, and now her prowess is the stuff of legends. It is said that those who practice the black arts quake when they hear that the Night Hunter is on the prowl. Despite her crusade, Shauna has looked at the League of Legends in horror. There are champions who have clearly lost themselves to the blackest of magics, and who have been embraced within the League even though they should be put down for the safety of all. The time has come for the Night Hunter to execute her secret mission – to purge the League of Legends.\n\nNot all shadows are to be feared. At least, if Vayne has her way.</Story>

    <Judgment date="6 May, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        She doesn't need to bend to examine the road. The witch's trail is obvious, even by moonlight. That last silver bolt had hit home, if the blood is any indication. The prey is slowed.
        \n\n
        The trail leads her past a public house. Though a few of the patrons cast wary glances as she walks past, the ruckus will cover up any unwanted noise. She hopes none of them have the sense to call the constabulary before she's done.
        \n\n
        The glow from the end of the alley reveals her prey. The witch is attempting to use hemomancy to close her wounds. From the looks of things, more than one of the silver bolts has landed. However, now the witch sees her and the magic changes. Droplets of blood fly towards her like a cloud of razors, but she effortlessly tumbles over a barrel and out of the way. Her crossbow is up before her feet even touch the ground and she fires. The bolt flies true, impaling the witch's casting hand and halting her vile spells.
        \n\n
        "Haley Manner, you have fallen to the practice of the black arts. You have willingly harmed others. You are condemned."
        \n\n
        She does not wait for the witch to respond with lies. She draws the great crossbow over her shoulder and unleashes its massive projectile. It strikes the witch with such force that it carries her back and into the wall of the public house, impaling her there, limp and silent at last.
        \n\n
        She can already hear the hue and cry. Though she is an agent of justice – many would say vengeance – Vayne's activities are not sanctioned by Demacian law. Nimbly, she leaps up, grabs hold of a ledge, and flips herself on top of the building. Leaping from roof-top to roof-top, she fades away into the darkness.
        \n\n
        Such is the way of the Night Hunter.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The summoners stared at her uneasily. After all, few potential champions have ever broken into one of the inner sanctums of the Institute of War, startled powerful summoners, and plainly demanded to be allowed into the League of Legends. Fortunately, Vayne's reputation had preceded her, so there was no need for violence.
        \n\n
        The room in which she sat now was sparse – nothing more than a fireplace with a few chairs. Vayne reflexively adjusted the crossbow on her arm. "When do we begin?" she asked.
        \n\n
        The summoner who seemed to be in charge of this process turned away from the fire. He was a gracefully aging man, approaching middle-age, with a quiet authority borne of true power. "In moments. First, I want to ask you how you managed to get past our defenses to gain access to the deeper chambers of the Institute."
        \n\n
        "The same way I know that you are Senior Summoner Ezekiel Montrose and that the woman with you is Summoner Lessa Carin. The same way I know that you take rose-hip tea every day, the route you walk to your home, and that you sleep on a very uncomfortable bed. I am the Night Hunter. Now get on with it. I have already submitted to your authority."
        \n\n
        After a moment of stunned silence, Senior Summoner Montrose finally spoke. "Since you are not one for pleasantries..."
        \n\n
        In an instant, it was as if the world had exploded. Then, as quickly as it came apart, it was back together again. However, it was many years ago, when Vayne was just a girl. She was back in the cupboard again.
        \n\n
        "Come out, little girl. Come out, or I will do to mummy what I have already done to daddy." The crone suspended her mother above the floor of the moonlit kitchen, the poor woman's limbs painfully and helplessly outstretched. Blood slowly dripped from her, dribbling from a hundred impossibly small cuts.
        \n\n
        The young Shauna Vayne was too terrified to move. There she was, trapped, frozen, and forced to watch through a crack in the cupboard door as the twisted witch brutally tortured the woman she loved more than any other.
        \n\n
        "I'll give you one last chance to come out, lassie." To punctuate, the crone made some mystical gesture that caused her mother to cry out in agony.
        \n\n
        Even if she'd wanted to, Shauna couldn't even cry out. The vise-like grip of fear prevented that.
        \n\n
        The crone cackled, the horrible sound echoing off the walls. "You are an awful child, girl, to make your mummy die this way."
        \n\n
        With each more horrifying shriek of pain and suffering that issued from her mother, something warm and bright in Vayne died. However, in its grave were planted the first seeds of a searing, merciless, and never-ending hatred...
        \n\n
        Disorientation, a blur of reality, and she was back in the Institute of War. Senior Summoner Montrose did his best to keep his composure, while all the color had drained from Summoner Carin's face. He broke the silence first. "I'm sorry for your loss."
        \n\n
        Vayne took several measured steps towards him. "Stay out of my head, summoner," she said in a surprisingly even tone. "You won't like what you find in the shadows."
        \n\n
        "We must," replied Summoner Carin, whose tiny frame carried a core of inner strength. "It is the way of the Judgment. How does it feel exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        However, Senior Summoner Montrose raised his hand to stop her. "I think the answer to that is obvious, Lessa. Shauna Vayne, let me ask you one simple question. Why do want to fight in the League of Legends."
        \n\n
        "To know my enemies. Though your magics keep them alive through defeat, I will learn more hunting those champions who are abominations than I would hunting their inferiors in the world."
        \n\n
        Senior Summoner Montrose considered her for a moment. "You will be a part of the League of Legends, Night Hunter. However, you must never violate our trust again. Agreed?"
        \n\n
        Vayne only nodded in assent. With that, she turned and walked from the room. Summoner Carin, confused for a moment, followed shortly behind her.
        \n\n
        A voice spoke from the shadows. "I do not trust her. Her mind is not an open book. She will only show us what she wants us to see." Emerging, as if one with the darkness around him, stepped Senior Summoner Sander Grieve. The intense-looking man was clad entirely in black, the Noxian cloak-clasp the only clue as to his heritage.
        \n\n
        "Yes," replied Montrose. "But I would rather have her here where we can watch her."
        \n\n
        Grieve sighed. "This will end badly. Mark my words."
        \n\n
        Montrose gave Grieve a piercing stare. "End badly for whom?"

    <Story>To most, thoughts of yordles do not conjure images to be feared. The easygoing half-pint race, though fierce, is often regarded with some degree of joviality. Their high-pitched voices and naturally cute forms inspire something of a protective instinct in the larger races, or at least bring to mind images of children playing at being adults. every now and again, however, a yordles turns so bad that, even at its small stature, it strikes terror into the hearts of others. Veigar is such a twisted yordle. As a master of the magical black arts, as well as a corruptor of cosmic energy, he is one of the most powerful sorcerers on Valoran.\n\nAs a child, Veigar was a normal yordle with one small exception - he had a deep curiosity for the world beyond Bandle City. The young yordle spent much of his time studying the rest of Valoran, and he jumped at the chance to join a business that traded with other major city-states. Unfortunately for both him and the world, a deal with Noxian trader turned into shady business and went bad; Veigar and his companions were subsequently set up to take the fall. Arrested by the authorities, he was imprisoned within the walls of Noxus for years. Such isolation is very dangerous for yordles - undoubtedly why his cruel jailers did such a thing - and Veigar was slowly driven mad. He eventually escaped, having become a twisted version of his former self. Instead of returning to his people and Bandle City, he sought tutelage from dark wizards across the land. With his demented will focused on one task, he quickly became a dangerous and powerful wizard in his own right. Now he seeks to end all conflict on Valoran by bringing all of the city-states to their knees, regardless of their affiliation. The League of Legends is the perfect tool to help him meet his ends - for now.\n\nWho says evil needs to come in a fearsome-looking package?</Story>

    <Story>
      Early in life, Viktor discovered his passion for science and invention, particularly in the field of mechanical automation. He attended Zaun's prestigious College of Techmaturgy and led the team that constructed Blitzcrank – a scientific breakthrough that he expected to vault him to the top of his profession. Unfortunately his triumph was usurped by Professor Stanwick, who stole credit for developing Blitzcrank's sentience and later used Viktor's research to revive Urgot. Viktor's appeals for justice fell on deaf ears, and he sank into a deep depression. He withdrew from the College and barricaded himself in his private laboratory, cutting all human ties. There, in secret, he conceived a project for which nobody else could claim credit. Desiring both to revolutionize his field and to eliminate the jealous human emotions which festered inside him, he engineered parts to replace and improve his own body. When Viktor re-emerged, almost no trace of the original man remained.
      \n\n
      Not only had he supplanted the majority of his anatomy, but his personality had changed. His previous hope to better society was replaced by an obsession with what he called ''the glorious evolution.'' He saw himself as the patron and pioneer of Valoran's future – a future in which man would renounce his flesh in favor of superior hextech augmentations. Though Viktor's initial appeals were met with heavy skepticism, scientists were confounded by the sophistication of his machinery. By integrating his mind with techmaturgical devices, he had been able to drastically accelerate the progress of his research. His transformation had stripped him of what he perceived as his emotional weaknesses, but there was some lingering residue of resentment against the Professor. Viktor joined the League of Legends to pit his inventions against the greatest opponents Valoran could offer, and to correct any weaknesses or inefficiencies that remained.

    <Story>There is a temple hidden in the mountains between Noxus and the Tempest Flats, where the secrets of an ancient and terrifying sorcery are kept.  The area surrounding the temple is littered with the exsanguinated corpses of those who have mistakenly wandered too close.  These served only to pique the curiosity of Vladimir, when - in his youth - he trekked through these mountains during his flight from Noxus.  A day earlier, the teenaged Vladimir had brutally murdered two boys his age, for no better reason than to enjoy the intoxicating scarlet bloom that surged forth.  He realized immediately that he would never be able to suppress his murderous desires, and if he remained in Noxus, his foul deeds were sure to catch up with him.  Without hesitation, he abandoned the city-state, and journeyed south.\n\nThe trail of bodies led him to a crumbling stone temple.  Inside he found an aging monk who appraised him with eyes of pure crimson.  Vladimir surprised the monk by returning the wicked gaze with zeal.  Recognizing the boy's sinister craving, the monk taught Vladimir how to manipulate and control the fluid of life, often practicing on passing travelers.  When it came time for Vladimir to learn the final lesson, the monk warned that failure would result in death.  Vladimir did not fail, but success bore a grisly surprise.  During the ritual, every drop of the monk's blood was drawn from his body and fused with Vladimir's, imbuing him with his master's magical essence, and that of every hemomancer before him.  Left alone and suddenly without purpose, Vladimir resolved to return to Noxus, demanding enrollment in the League to prove the supremacy of his craft.  When the Noxian High Command observed the gruesome fates which befell the palace guards, they elected to avail themselves of Vladimir's unsavory talents.\n\n''That which runs through you will run you through.''\n-Vladimir\n</Story>

      <Observation>
        Vladimir moves with purpose, his long hair and robes flowing dramatically behind him as his deliberate strides carry him swiftly towards his goal. The heels of his polished boots ring out against the marble halls of the Institute of War, an unwelcome clamor in the otherwise oppressive silence. He spies his destination ahead, a great stone doorway.
        \n\n
        The regal demeanor of our guest is a hoax; a trap for those foolish enough not to look beyond the surface. The perfectly groomed hair, the extravagant attire, the manicured fingernails… these marks of nobility are false. The truly perceptive will not be deceived by this charade. From his cruel, angular features, to the vicious, yet regal, jewelry that adorns his fingertips, there is no doubt: this is a predator.
        \n\n
        Vladimir pauses for a moment as he arrives, relishing the moment. He admires the craftsmanship with fickle, covetous eyes. A pair of panthers stand sentry in the relief of the marble archway, their lithe forms a tribute to their artisan's talent. An inscription above announces his destination: "The truest opponent lies within." He reaches out to caress the polished stone. The doors part at his touch, drifting silently open. Beyond them lay blackness. Vladimir licks his thin lips, and darts inside.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Vladimir stood in the darkness of the Reflecting Chamber. For a moment there was only the silence and the expectant beating of his heart. Then there was a whisper.
        \n\n
        "Vladimir, my child," called a voice from the black. He recognized it instantly, and his hair stood on end. Out of the darkness strode another figure, of similar stature but clothed in the simpler robes of a monk. His ashen hair was rivaled only by the sickly pallor of his skin. His eyes were pure crimson.
        \n\n
        "Dmitri?" Vladimir inquired, incredulous, "but, master, you are gone. I killed you."
        \n\n
        The figure threw back his head, howling with laughter. "I cannot be gone, Vladimir. I am a part of you." As if in response, the monk's body dissolved into a fine red mist. The metallic smell of blood filled the air. Vladimir closed his eyes and breathed deeply, the warm vapor bathing him in its welcome embrace.
        \n\n
        The sound of sharp, labored breaths woke him from his reverie. His eyes snapped open, revealing a clearing in a serene forest. His heart raced in an excited rhythm. At his feet lay two mangled forms - one still, the other gasping - both drenched in blood. Vladimir examined himself in wonder. He was a boy no older than fifteen. In his right hand he clutched a hunting knife in a death grip - so hard, in fact, that the handle had cut him. His fine clothes were sullied everywhere with scarlet. He knew this moment. These were his playmates. These were his first.
        \n\n
        The maimed figure crawled towards him, looking up with a mixture of sadness and bewilderment. The expression turned to hatred. A hand shot forward, gripping his boot. Vladimir recoiled, breaking free and stumbling backwards away from the dying child. The boy opened his mouth as if to scream, but no words came out. Instead, a torrent of blood spilled forth from his lips into the dirt. He extended an accusing finger at his murderer. Vladimir dropped his knife, and the darkness took him.
        \n\n
        A moment later he was standing at the foot of a mountain trail in the shadow of a great structure. Before him, propped on a spike, lay a blanched corpse. Beneath that lay a font of blood, hewn into the rocks by primitive tools. He looked up, raising a hand to shield his wind-burned face. The trail before him contained perhaps a dozen such specimens, set at even intervals along the path. He felt the now familiar quickening of his pulse. The thrill overwhelming any sense of dread, he ascended.
        \n\n
        Wandering through the halls of this ancient structure, the trail of drained bodies guiding his path, Vladimir's excitement grew. He came at last to a great hall. All about him hung the deceased, their lifeblood settling in pools below. At the front of the grisly scene stood a robed monk, white hair slicked back out of his face. His blood-red eyes shone menacingly on his pale, implacable face as he beckoned to the enraptured traveler.
        \n\n
        Vladimir approached, unblinking; entranced by the spectacle, eyes locked on the man before him. The monk stared back curiously. "Have you no fear, boy?" he asked, interested. Vladimir shook his head wordlessly, never breaking his gaze.
        \n\n
        "I see what you are," the monk continued, "You are a harbinger, my child. A Crimson Reaper, come to collect." He smiled grimly, a peal of laughter following. "What is your name, young one?"
        \n\n
        "I am called Vladimir," stammered the bewildered youth.
        \n\n
        "You are now my charge, Vladimir," replied the aging figure, smiling. "Do not disappoint me."
        \n\n
        Vladimir stared deeply into his mentor's eyes. The sight made his veins run ice. He had killed this man. He had taken his blood. And Dmitri had asked him to do it; had threatened him with death if he refused. The room around him went dark once more, leaving him alone again with the phantom of his master. The monk folded his arms across his chest. "Why do you want to join the League, Vladimir?" asked Dmitri expectantly.
        \n\n
        "I wish to bring honor to my noble house and to hone my craft," Vladimir answered immediately.
        \n\n
        The apparition before cracked a bemused smiled. "Why do you want to join the League, Vladimir?" it repeated.
        \n\n
        "To fight for the glory of Noxus, my homeland," Vladimir replied, hesitant.
        \n\n
        Dimitri's amusement vanished. He looked displeased. "Why do you want to join the League, Vladimir?" he echoed.
        \n\n
        Vladimir's face darkened. He answered, slowly this time, "I must kill."
        \n\n
        The old monk nodded. "How does it feel, exposing your mind?" he asked.
        \n\n
        Vladimir bared his teeth. "Liberating, really," came his retort. As if in response, the door behind flew open, bathing him in light. He was alone.

    <Story>
      Though the northern reaches of Freljord are some of the most unforgiving lands in Valoran, the Ursine have survived upon the region's barren, stormy tundra for centuries. As a fierce and respected warrior of the Ursine, Volibear devoted his life to the protection of his people and loyalty to his elder brother, the tribe's chief. When his brother was killed during a hunt on the tundra, the tribe looked to Volibear as his successor. It was an honor and a burden that Volibear had never expected, but he shouldered the charge with pride. However, by Ursine tradition, the tribe could not recognize Volibear as chief until he returned from a journey to the peak of their sacred mountain, a place forever shrouded in a thundering maelstrom. There, Ursine chieftains must speak to the storm itself, gaining clarity and wisdom to empower them as mighty leaders.
      \n\n
      Donning the chieftain's traditional armor and enchanted gauntlets, Volibear began the long and perilous climb up the slopes of the mountain. When he reached the peak and gazed into the raging storm above, he saw a horrific vision of a Freljord utterly consumed by war. Amidst the carnage, the Ursine fell dead upon a bloody battlefield. Believing the vision to be an omen of things to come if he did not act against them, Volibear traveled to the capitol of Freljord. The Ursine had not ventured across the southern mountains in centuries and his appearance was met with unease. However, Queen Ashe recognized Volibear as a wise and powerful ally. In what Volibear considered the first step against a war-torn future, they forged an alliance. As part of their agreement, he joined the League of Legends in the name of a unified Freljord, representing the primal might of his nation on the Field of Justice.

    <Story>Warwick counted himself amongst the most powerful and revered men in his home city-state of Zaun.  Over the course of his infamous career as an alchemist, Warwick won many honors for his craft, not the least of which was a lucrative offer for service in the Noxian military during their campaigns against Ionia.  Sequestered in his labs far from the front lines, Warwick and his apprentice Singed toiled relentlessly to manufacture all manner of appalling concoctions for the Noxian army.  So potent was his art that even the greatest of Ionia's healers - under the leadership of the Starchild Soraka - struggled to combat the poisons and chemical weapons generated by his despicable mind.  Warwick's reign of terror grew so horrific that his very name became a curse in the eyes of his Ionian foes, and they began referring to him only as ''the Deathmaker.''\n\nBut even one under the protection of the Noxian High Command is not wholly beyond the reach of retribution.  For as Soraka strode across the myriad of death and destruction left in the wake of one of Warwick's chemical attacks, her heart finally gave way.  She called down the wrath of the cosmos on Warwick, wishing that his form should mirror the cruelty in his heart - a curse that would come at the price of her aspiring divinity.  Within his laboratory, a terrible thirst took hold over Warwick. As his apprentice looked on in horror, Warwick threw open the doors to his bastion and sprinted off toward parts unknown, a bloodcurdling howling marking his passage. He had become a werewolf; a wild, murderous beast.  Today, the Blood Hunter fights for Noxus within the League of Legends... thankful of the curse that his now-mortal enemy bestowed upon him.\n\n''The rage of the beast now complements his predatory spirit.'' -- Singed, the Mad Chemist, upon witnessing his master's transformation\n</Story>

  <Champion name="Wukong" title="The Monkey King" range="125" gender="m" rp="975" ip="6300" abilityVideoID="0062">
    <Story>In the Plague Jungles, Kong ruled as king. He could wield a unique, natural form of magic and he was driven by zealous ambition. The Plague Jungles were the ideal setting for fostering his growth - he thrived on challenges and flourished in adversity. However, when he had surmounted every obstacle and defeated every opponent, he grew restless. Worried that there was nothing left to overcome, he sought counsel with the monkey sage who lived behind the Grand Waterfall. The sage told him a tale of hairless monkeys to the north who, with wits and strength, bent the world to their will. Kong was overjoyed at the prospect of such worthy competition, and he immediately set out to the north, hoping that the sage's story was true.\n\nTraveling north, he crossed the Southern Wastes and then the Great Barrier. Unaware of the League, he arrived outside the Institute of War where he found Master Yi in meditation. Kong was eager to test the strength of these northern warriors, so he challenged Yi to a duel. Intrigued by Kong, Yi decided to humor him. Within moments of his first strike, Kong knew he was no match for Yi. To be the best, he would need a mentor. He asked Yi to take him as a pupil and to show him the wonders of the northern lands. In return, he would honor Yi by becoming the greatest warrior Runeterra had ever seen. Admiring his passion, Yi agreed, but only under the condition that Kong would one day teach the lessons of Wuju to a pupil of his own. In the spirit of this agreement, he renamed Kong ''Wukong'', and gave him a weapon suited to his unusual nature - an enchanted staff that the young Doran had crafted. The weapon was an unrivalled masterpiece. After rigorous training, Wukong joined the League of Legends to fulfill his promise and show the world the true power of Wuju.\n\n"The first step to wisdom and greatness is realizing how little you know."\n- The first lesson of Master Yi</Story>

    <Judgment date="22 July, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Wukong charges into the Great Hall, bursting with anticipation. The promise of a challenge excites him. His movements seem frenzied and wild, but for all their apparent disorganization, he never seems to be off-balance. His head darts from side to side. It’s unclear whether he is watching for threats or trying to take everything in at once – probably both.
        \n\n
        When he is satisfied that has seen or poked everything in the area, he proceeds to the doors. This moment has been too long in the waiting.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Wukong was still unaccustomed to the confining structures that humans liked to build around themselves. He could understand the need for shelter, but in a place where man’s society dominated the landscape, there weren’t many dangers left. Master Yi had explained the concept of “privacy” to him at length (mainly because Wukong’s prying curiosity apparently often violated it), but he still didn’t quite understand why people would willingly spend so much time cut off from the world around them. Did they not enjoy the sun on their skin? Or the scents carried on the wind? Maybe it’s just a fur thing, he mused.
        \n\n
        In the Plague Jungles, Wukong would spend nights on the highest bough of the tallest tree, drifting asleep to the melody of thousands of creatures serenading the starlight. Despite all the wonders man had achieved, nothing had quite the same simple elegance. It seemed the nature of people was to seek out and foster complications in their lives until even the most fundamental behaviors came with guidelines and instructions: table manners, bathroom etiquette, courting rituals, rules of engagement. To breach any rule was to invite further complications. It was exhausting and often pointless.
        \n\n
        However, for all the quirks that humans had, they were truly remarkable, and their warriors presented Wukong with challenges he couldn’t find in the Plague Jungles – challenges he once worried might not exist. He recalled the feeling of desperation that day, right after his bout with the sea dragon, when his every goal had been realized, every opponent defeated. His frantic ambition gave him drive and purpose, but consumed him when deprived an outlet. Like him, it was a product of the Plague Jungles, where uneven concentrations of magic and life would well up until they burst – evolution in overdrive.
        \n\n
        The nearby crunch of a crushed leaf jarred him from his thoughts.
        \n\n
        Instinctively, Wukong bent backward, just in time to avoid the sweep of a familiar weapon. As it passed over him, he could make out Doran’s distinctive craftsmanship – it was his own staff. Had someone stolen it? His focus fell to his fingers and he was relieved to find it still clutched within them.
        \n\n
        Wukong allowed his momentum to carry him into a backflip, and he brought the weapon up defensively the second his feet touched the soil. Soil…where am I? He glanced at his surroundings and recognized the vibrant ferns, towering kopak trees, and sprawling vines in an instant.
        \n\n
        How had he returned to the Plague Jungles? More importantly, who had just attacked him?
        \n\n
        He scanned the immediate area but could find no sign of the aggressor. There was no way anyone could have gotten away so fast. He peered through the lush vegetation, looking for signs of someone’s passing. He had the space of a gasp to notice a curious shadow before he was struck squarely in the chest by a jab from the imposter weapon. It came from nearly twenty feet away, stretching several times its normal length to reach him. Knockoff or not, it apparently shared the unique qualities of the original.
        \n\n
        The blow knocked the wind out of him, and sent him sliding along the jungle’s mossy floor. He stayed on his feet, but struggled to maintain his composure as he coaxed air back into his lungs. A blur in the corner of his vision announced the next assault, and Wukong was able to identify his assailant’s glinting gold armor before he was beset by a flurry of attacks. The form was unmistakable.
        \n\n
        It’s... me?
        \n\n
        On his heels, Wukong could barely keep upright as he parried the furious onslaught. The rogue clone was faster than he was, and its strikes were well-chosen and well-placed. Wukong tried to control the clone as he would one of his own illusions, although he was unsurprised when that failed. This clone wasn’t one of his tricks, it was something different entirely. Had the jungle produced another, possibly better monkey king? He was horrified by the thought.
        \n\n
        Wukong saw an opening in the clone’s barrage, and he unleashed a powerful blow. He timed it perfectly – the clone had no time to react before Wukong’s staff collided with its jaw.
        \n\n
        When he made contact, the clone vanished in a puff of smoke.
        \n\n
        Uh oh. Wukong knew this tactic all too well. He tried to block the attack he knew would come from behind but he wasn’t fast enough. Bright pain filled his vision and he collapsed face-first into mud and ferns. As he tried to blink the world back into his eyes, the clone circled him slowly, savoring its advantage.
        \n\n
        “Why do you want to join the League, Wukong?” The question, delivered in his own voice, rattled him.
        \n\n
        “To be the best,” he rasped, spitting dirt.
        \n\n
        “You have a long way to go.”
        \n\n
        “That’s the fun part.” Wukong got to one knee. “When you’re at the top, there’s nowhere left to go.” He eyed the clone curiously, perhaps things weren’t as they seemed. “But I’m not as far away as you think.”
        \n\n
        He grinned mischievously, and the clone lashed out with its staff, sensing danger. All it hit was a cloud of smoke. Wukong hurtled through the air behind it, one hand latched onto a vine, the other holding the staff out like a lance. The clone whirled around faster than the eye could see, its staff cutting a vicious arc for Wukong. It hit its mark perfectly, and just in time, but Wukong just burst into another cloud.
        \n\n
        The trees were coming alive now. Another Wukong swung down from a vine, then another, and another. The clone moved like a machine, barely intercepting every attack but slowly becoming obscured in fog as they all dispersed harmlessly in front of it. It tried to move, to find some better ground, but Wukongs poured from the trees, surrounding and suppressing it with unrelenting strikes. One Wukong stood outside the cloud, arms folded, watching as the clone struggled to resist being overwhelmed.
        \n\n
        “You know, human, things are different in the Plague Jungles. We aren’t provided for, we aren’t protected. Most creatures don’t fight for fun here – most fight to survive.” He ducked as the clone’s staff, shooting out from the cloud, sought to land a lucky strike. “But I fight to be the best. That’s what makes me special. That’s why I left to find your League. That’s why I will be the greatest.”
        \n\n
        The clone was visibly losing steam. Wukong plucked a peach from a nearby tree and took a bite. It tasted divine.
        \n\n
        “As a people, you have the world at your fingertips, but alone, most of you crumble in the face of true adversity,” he slurped through a mouthful of peach.
        \n\n
        Suddenly, before his eyes, the jungle dissolved. He dropped the peach, but it was gone before it reached the ground. Only the clone remained against a backdrop of darkness. Its eyes burned brightly, but its expression was pleased.
        \n\n
        “How does it feel, exposing your mind?”
        \n\n
        Wukong tapped the clone on the shoulder from behind, the Wukong it was facing vanished, leaving the same poof of smoke.
        \n\n
        “I told you I wasn’t as far as you thought,” he said with a smile.
        \n\n
        Scowling, the clone disappeared and then Wukong was back in the Institute. He chuckled. Humans and their rituals. Nonetheless, another trial passed, another obstacle overcome. Now it was time to put this League to the test.

    <Story>In the ancient civilization of Shurima, the mage called Xerath practiced magic with undying passion. He believed that with enough magical power, he could gaze into the heart of Runeterra to know the secrets of history and the universe beyond. Such magic was beyond the limitations of a mortal body, but Xerath obsessively pursued a path to infinite power nonetheless. With every breakthrough he grew more and more powerful, yet not without consequence. Xerath's increasing arcane abilities wrought havoc on his physical form. Desperate, he undertook a dangerous ritual to transcend his dying body. The outcome would be immortality or self-destruction. Violent magic unleashed during the ritual caused devastation throughout Shurima, but when the dust settled, Xerath emerged as an ascended being of pure arcane energy.\n\nFree of flesh and bone, Xerath held nearly infinite power at his command. However, in the wake of his chaotic ritual, the mages of Shurima feared his careless disregard for life would bring ruin to the kingdom. After a terrible struggle they subdued Xerath, but they could not destroy his ascended form. Instead they trapped him within an enchanted sarcophagus and sealed him in an underground tomb. Eons passed, civilizations rose and fell, and Xerath's imprisonment was lost to memory. For centuries, Xerath's vast power tore away at the sarcophagus and weakened its spell. Finally, he willed forth a burst of magic that shattered his prison, but its core remained, containing Xerath and his power within its broken pieces. Seeking to rid himself of this burden, he was drawn to the magic of Valoran's nexuses and found he could absorb their power. Yet the nexuses had gatekeepers: petty mages known as summoners. Xerath knew his key to true freedom from his prison lay in gaining their trust, and he offered his power to the League of Legends.\n\n“I have no need for vengeance. Time has brought ruin to the mages of Shurima and I alone remain.”\n– Xerath, the Magus Ascendant</Story>

    <Judgment date="4 October, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Aside from the vaguely human shape within the shattered remnants of his sarcophagus, there is very little indication that the being called Xerath was ever a man. His presence is cold and unfeeling, with nothing to be read upon the iron mask one might call his face.
        \n\n
        He does not pause to observe the hallway around him. Xerath approaches the massive doors to the Reflection Chamber and, with a sweep of his arm, they open before him.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The doors had only just closed behind Xerath when a sandstorm obscured his vision. Violent, stinging wind surrounded him, and he realized in horror that it began to eat away at his very form. The shattered pieces of his sarcophagus withered into wisps of sand. Worse still, Xerath felt himself grow weak. As his prison disappeared into the storm, the arcane energy that made up his form faded with it, replaced by flesh and bone.
        \n\n
        The sands of time had turned against him. He was human again.
        \n\n
        Around him, the storm took shape in the darkness. He recognized the sandstone walls and the statues that rose from the floor to the ceiling. These regal figures clasped scepters to their chests, and their eyes, plated in gold, gazed eternally down upon those below them. He was in the Temple of the Falcon, where all the mages of Shurima practiced their craft.
        \n\n
        The peers of Xerath’s youth sparred beneath their Magi ancestors. They threw fire and ice and twisted magic into the shapes of blades, honing the arcane into weaponry. Such was the charge of mages: the greatest masters of magic would stand victorious over Shurima’s conquered foes.
        \n\n
        Xerath watched silently at the temple's wall, entranced by the light from their spells. Nothing whetted his thirst for understanding as the pure arcane. Its dull glow called to him, and in its depths he knew there lay a thousand secrets.
        \n\n
        “Why do you not join them, Xerath?”
        \n\n
        The voice broke his focus. Tabia, one of his fellow mages, stood beside him. Her sudden appearance and the look of her smile made him stumble with his words for a moment. “Ah... well… we have our differences.”
        \n\n
        "You are a mage of Shurima," Tabia said. She moved closer to him. “We have the same path. What differences do you mean?”
        \n\n
        “The way they bend their magic,” he replied, turning his gaze back to the other mages.
        \n\n
        “They make weapons of it, but they don’t understand. The more you force your control over it, the more you lose your true connection to the arcane.”
        \n\n
        "Magic is chaotic. You know the lessons. Without a mage's guiding hand, we can only hope to control what the arcane does and does not destroy."
        \n\n
        "Yes, but if it's pure power we want..." Xerath cupped his hand. In the curl of his slender fingers, a blue-violet flame sparked into existence. He knew he could shape it as he wished, but he simply let it burn.
        \n\n
        On its own, with only the slightest prodding, the flame grew. Soon it burned fiercely in his hand, its raw power coursing through him and warming his very core.
        \n\n
        “All it needs is a vessel,” he said.
        \n\n
        He turned his gaze up from the flame to see Tabia looking at him, not his magic. She smiled again, and her beauty drew his mind away from the arcane. Between them, the flame grew stronger…
        \n\n
        …and then reality blurred around him.
        \n\n
        The temple darkened and Tabia’s face faded from his view. For a moment he remembered the summoners' trick and the Institute of War, but pain drew him back into another memory.
        \n\n
        Sheer, limitless power set him aflame from the inside out. Deep within, at his very core, he felt a searing agony where the fire burned too hot, threatening to burn its way to the surface, to consume and destroy him.
        \n\n
        The arcane needed a vessel… but his frail human form could only hold so much.
        \n\n
        Xerath grimaced. “I will not allow this mortal body to stop me." He held out his hand. Arcane fire sprung from his fingertips, crackling with power as it formed runes that hung briefly in the air.
        \n\n
        The burning, blinding-white magic quickly grew to a tumultuous wind around him. An ancestral statue shattered, its pieces crashing to the ground and shaking the foundation of the temple. It took all of his strength and will to hold the spell. Even then it swelled and flared, threatening to break free.
        \n\n
        But a voice rose above the chaos. “Xerath! Stop!”
        \n\n
        Tabia.
        \n\n
        Xerath’s hold over the ritual wavered as he turned towards her voice. She stood at the foot of a Magi ancestor, her dark hair a stark frame to her pale, beautiful face.
        \n\n
        "You mustn't do this," she shouted, her eyes burning fearlessly. "It will consume you. It is killing you already, and you would only let it do its work faster!"
        \n\n
        "Tabia," Xerath pleaded, his voice hoarse and trembling. "Please, you don't understand…"
        \n\n
        The spiraling arcane twisted and pulsed like a storm above them. Xerath felt it slip further from his grasp.
        \n\n
        "You do not need this," she said, and there was pleading in her voice, too. "Stop it now, and you can heal. You can have life again. I can help you," she paused. "Come home."
        \n\n
        Xerath's will faltered. Perhaps she was right. He imagined himself at home, away from the Magi and the arcane forever, and all the pain it had caused him. The way it had eaten at him from within, all gone. Perhaps...
        \n\n
        Tabia mouthed something, but Xerath could not hear her. The statue above her shuddered and began to collapse.
        \n\n
        "Tabia! NO!"
        \n\n
        At the sound of Tabia’s scream, the rest of the statues and the Temple walls began to crumble with the force of Xerath’s spell. He'd lost control. At its center, he covered his face with his hands, shouting her name in agony. His brief vision of home and escape from the arcane had been lost as soon as he’d found the strength to reach for it.
        \n\n
        It was too late to stop the spell. It would consume him, too, and he trembled in terror at the prospect. All of his efforts for naught... everything he'd worked for, lost.
        \n\n
        Unless he finished the ritual.
        \n\n
        He hesitated. Part of him wished to accept death, but a greater part still remembered what he'd set out to do—to become something greater. To transcend the mortal body that held other mages back.
        \n\n
        He had nothing left but this. Though his whole body ached with weakness, Xerath steeled himself.
        \n\n
        I will become eternal... or I will die.
        \n\n
        He raised his arms and the writhing mass of magic above him again gained some semblance of form, but still it expanded, destroying the remaining Magi statues and the temple's walls. Xerath pulled the spell inward with all the strength he could muster, blocking out what he could see of the temple collapsing around him.
        \n\n
        For a moment, in the chaos of the arcane, he could see a reflection of himself: a pale, emaciated man, aged well beyond his years.
        \n\n
        As the spell engulfed him, Xerath's eyes were full of fear.
        \n\n
        In an instant, the chaos subsided. Xerath was back in the Reflection Chamber, and a hooded summoner stood before him.
        \n\n
        "All that power," said the summoner, "And now you are a prisoner."
        \n\n
        "An inconvenience," Xerath replied, his voice echoing through the chamber.
        \n\n
        "Yet not what you envisioned when you took control of that spell. Do you have regret, Magus?"
        \n\n
        "I do not."
        \n\n
        The summoner scowled. "You sacrificed yourself, your people, and the woman you loved... all for power. Power you can no longer reach."
        \n\n
        "As I said," Xerath continued. "An inconvenience. I will be free."
        \n\n
        "Why do you want to join the League, Xerath?"
        \n\n
        At this, Xerath paused. "The burden of my prison was brought about because the mages of Shurima could not comprehend what it was I pursued. I will not allow my goals to be misunderstood again. Consider my work with your League, summoner, a show of good faith."
        \n\n
        The summoner regarded him quietly for a moment before giving a curt nod. "As you say. How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        Xerath turned away. “I am no longer the naïve student you have exposed," he said, "My previous existence means nothing."

    <Story>*Whenever Jarvan III, the king of Demacia, delivers one of his rallying speeches from the glinting marble balcony atop the Royal Palace, Xin Zhao is at his side. Coined the Seneschal of Demacia, Xin Zhao is the personal steward of the Lightshield Dynasty. His enigmatic, silent vigil has led to an abundance of conjecture concerning his ''secret life'' and origins. Whether it's ''Zaun double-agent'' tendered at the dinner table or ''indebted rune mage'' mused in the editorials of the ''Demacian Constant'', Xin Zhao betrays no hints to sate the curiosity of the masses... for good reason.\n\nPrior to the formation of the League, Noxus was renowned for a spectacle called The Fleshing. It was a gladiatorial event with a cruel twist: as a fighter won matches, his number of opponents (generally prisoners of war) fought simultaneously would increase. This meant eventual death for every contender, but with unparalleled glory. Xin Zhao, known then as Viscero, was slated to face 300 soldiers, nearly six times the previous record. This was clearly meant to be his final match. Jarvan II, hearing of this unprescedented feat, infiltrated the arena to offer him an alternative: serve Demacia and punish those who ultimately sentence him to death in exchange for his freedom. Xin Zhao accepted, astonished that a king would risk his own life on his behalf. Under the cover of a prearranged Demacian assault on Noxus, Jarvan liberated Xin Zhao and his 300 opponents. During their retreat, Xin Zhao took a poisoned dart meant for Jarvan. This act of loyalty, from a man who vowed no allegiance, earned Xin Zhao a spot at his side until the day the king died. Now in the service of his son, Jarvan III, Xin Zhao is stepping into a new ring - the Fields of Justice - to fight for his adopted country and to honor the legacy of the man who gave purpose to his life.\n\n''Death is inevitable, one can only avoid defeat.''\n      -  Demacian Manual of Arms</Story>

    <Judgment date="13 July, 20 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Xin Zhao's presence, although patently reserved, seems to resound throughout the Great Hall as he enters. An expression of stoic determination drapes across his face, as oft-worn as his polished Demacian plates. His signature topknot billows behind him, white streaks glinting with every flicker of the lamps. In one hand, he carries a bladed battering ram passed off as a spear. He feigns difficulty bearing its weight, a ploy to mislead those with sharp eyes but brash wits.
        \n\n
        His gaze never drifts from the ornate doors of the Reflecting Chamber, but he has analyzed every nuance of the Hall, from the spiked epaulets adorning the Statue of Thurmit to the slinking stress fracture snaking through the northern wall. He stalks to the doors with a stride that would be unhampered waist-deep in tar, and pauses to examine the inscription etched above.
        \n\n
        The truest opponent lies within.
        \n\n
        With a touch, the looming marble doors part obligingly. Beyond them, a pervasive blackness spills forth, sprawling at his feet as the doors widen. This murk – the harnessed essence of darkness – absorbs light, cascading negative shadows around the rim of the entryway. Unimpressed by the conjuration, Xin Zhao steps into the blanketing ink.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        The absence of light didn’t bother Xin Zhao much; he’d been blinded in fights before. He touched his forehead, fingers tracing a scar left by the edge of a Demacian shield, remembering the sensation of blood pooling in his eyes. The wound was a parting souvenir from a man the Noxian papers had called the Bone Grinder.
        \n\n
        Funny name, really. They should have called him the Squeaker.
        \n\n
        A gap in the Squeaker’s teeth caused him to whistle whenever he exhaled, an effect which became quite ridiculous when he panted. Xin Zhao had dispatched the Squeaker handily back then, although cockiness blinded him to the obvious shield strike. He could still hear the Squeaker’s fateful battle cry – tinged with that absurd whistle – amidst the roar of thousands of bloodthirsty onlookers, attendants of The Fleshing. The familiar acrid stench of the arena still stung his nose, the perfume of bile dripping from slain opponents who lay scattered in all directions. He could still see the Squeaker’s eyes, lit with rage through slits in his tarnished helm, as he feinted with his chipped broadsword, shield poised to strike. Wait, he could see him.
        \n\n
        It was a disorienting sensation, watching an image of the mind’s eye manifesting in reality. Xin Zhao had barely enough time to duck, the tower shield raking the length of his mane. Instinctively, he dove away, falling unceremoniously on his haunches but narrowly evading a spinning slash as the Squeaker whirled about. His right hand tightened, seeking the reassurance of his spear, but his fingers grasped only palm. How had he been disarmed? The crowd above was chanting for carnage. Xin Zhao glanced up, noticing faces he’d seen before in another life. Capitalizing on his opponent's confusion, the Squeaker lunged, a fatal sword thrust obscured behind his battered shield. Sitting in the sand, Xin Zhao was caught unprepared, too late to dodge, too late to think.
        \n\n
        The Squeaker’s blade slid into the flesh between Xin Zhao’s eyes, its tip pressing against his skull. Gazing dully forward, his eyes focused on the base of the enemy blade, where he found his left hand clenched, a crimson trickle dripping down his wrist. He almost chuckled. While his mind reeled, desperately trying to cope with the recent series of events, his body, ever-vigilant, never failed him.
        \n\n
        In a single motion, Xin Zhao was on his feet, his right hand snapping the blade with a decisive strike. He detected a squeak of surprise as he moved. His left hand – still gripping the severed blade – shot forward, finding its mark in the eye of the Squeaker’s helm. A thick, wet sound echoed in return, followed by a deafening cheer from the crowd.
        \n\n
        To Xin Zhao's horror, the Squeaker did not topple over as expected; instead, he sat down calmly. Xin Zhao recoiled into a defensive stance, but the Squeaker only yanked the shard from his eye and shucked the helm. Xin Zhao fell to his knees, at once recognizing the blood-drenched face of his mentor, King Jarvan II of Demacia. Jarvan smiled, pleased with Xin Zhao’s distress.
        \n\n
        "Why do you want to join the League, Xin Zhao?" The whistle was gone.
        \n\n
        Xin Zhao’s voice cracked, "What trickery is this?"
        \n\n
        "Answer the question."
        \n\n
        "I represent Demacia... and her...true king." Some part of Xin Zhao was aware that this was a cruel mirage, but the weight in his heart prevailed over reason.
        \n\n
        "To defeat your archenemy, Noxus?"
        \n\n
        "To serve the best interests of Demacia."
        \n\n
        A pause. “How does it feel, exposing your mind?” The mutilated eye twitched, apparently attempting to study Xin Zhao’s response.
        \n\n
        Horrible beyond comparison. "Not what I expected."
        \n\n
        "Horrible beyond comparison? Really?" Jarvan gestured at the carcasses all around them. "And you have so much in your life to which you could compare."
        \n\n
        "I’ve had enough of this. Have I passed your test?" Xin Zhao was tired of the game, tired of being vulnerable.
        \n\n
        "We've finished with you Xin Zhao, but you'll soon find that the true test has not yet begun."
        \n\n
        The arena and the grinning, one-eyed face of Jarvan dissolved in a puff of black smoke. Xin Zhao found himself standing in a claustrophobic antechamber, facing a long corridor which he knew led to the League. Behind him, the ornate marble doors swung open softly, offering retreat.
        \n\n
        He wanted to crumple. He wanted to turn and leave, never to set eyes on this place again. Instead, he heard the voice of Jarvan in his head. This time he knew it wasn't an illusion.
        \n\n
        "This world is in need of men with the courage to bear weight which otherwise would crush us all. You’re a Demacian at heart, Xin Zhao. Have confidence in your strength, and your knees will never buckle."
        \n\n
        Xin Zhao rose to his fullest height and marched into the League of Legends.

    <Story>The work of gravediggers is essential amongst the living, but invaluable in the Shadow Isles. There are many shades of death there, and each is embraced rather than feared or reviled. One can only ascend from one state to the next with the magical aid of a skilled professional. At the end of the first Rune War, Yorick Mori made his living as a gravedigger. His family owned and maintained the Final Rest Memorial, one of the oldest cemeteries in Valoran. The shovel he employed for his work had been passed down for generations. Each gravedigger taught his son that this shovel was imbued with the spirit of every forefather, and that those spirits would protect him during the long lonely nights amongst the tombstones. To his eternal regret, Yorick died without an heir, bringing the proud Mori line to a close. His body was interred with his shovel in the family mausoleum, and the Final Rest Memorial soon fell to ruin. Death, however, was not the end Yorick had expected.\n\nYorick emerged on the haunted shores of the Shadow Isles - not quite dead, definitely not alive - still clutching his beloved shovel. He soon learned that with it he could act as a ferryman for the Isles' undead denizens, helping them climb death's many-tiered ladder. This proved a curse, as a gravedigger must ''bury his quota'' before he too can ascend, or so the legend goes. No one knows what ''his quota'' is. Yorick dug tirelessly, waiting in vain for the day when he would be freed of his burden. As decades turned to centuries, the shame of his failures came to a head. He returned to Valoran to find his corpse, convinced that salvation might be buried with it. When he arrived, no trace remained of either the mausoleum or the memorial. Hope nearly lost, he discovered the League of Legends, and there saw an opportunity to immortalize the family name he allowed to be forgotten ages ago.\n\n''Die first, then we'll talk.''\n-Yorick</Story>

    <Judgment date="17 June, 21 CLE">
      <Observation>
        Yorick finds the mountain's entrance after tireless searching. He has learned about the League in fragments; the unusual nature of death on the Fields of Justice intrigues him. He has no interest in games or politics, but a selfish impulse compels him.
        \n\n
        He is hunched, built to purpose, strong. He clutches a shovel always – it is this grip that has held him to this world. He is at once terrifying and pitiful, an aged corpse which cannot rest. He ambles to the space designed for his Judgment, stone doors at the edge of the mountain. The darkness wraps around him as he enters. Its color suits him.
      </Observation>
      <Reflection>
        Darkness didn't bother Yorick. He'd spent most of his life in darkness and, more significantly, countless lifetimes beyond.
        \n\n
        A lifetime... hmph. Warmskins have such narrow scopes.
        \n\n
        Yorick could barely recall his early years in the Shadow Isles, diligently tallying the passing days, then months, then years. When the inner walls of his cave were nothing more than a maelstrom of crooked lines, he stopped. There was no more point to counting days in death than counting breaths in life. He wondered briefly how many lifetimes he might have tallied – another utterly useless exercise.
        \n\n
        The chirp of crickets penetrated his thoughts. It was the kind of sound that softly framed deep contemplation, but became piercing madness when focused upon; more life fretting its hour, grasping for purpose, like flames dancing on their coals.
        \n\n
        The smell of damp soil greeted him like an old friend, sprawling out around him. Yorick appraised his surroundings.
        \n\n
        He stood amongst rows of gravestones which stretched in all directions seemingly without end. There was a pregnant stillness in the air that characterized places that bridged life and death. It was a quality that permeated every inch of the Shadow Isles, though life had long since abandoned its shores. Yorick once mused that these gardens of fresh death were lumps caught in the throat of existence, stale with unease as they contemplated their crossroads.
        \n\n
        Now he merely wondered why there was a corpse here.
        \n\n
        The body was laid out on a wagon next to a new but nameless tombstone. Bodies didn't bother him – quite the contrary. The prospect of ushering souls through the many rungs of death was one of the few thrills permitted to a gravedigger from the Shadow Isles. Rather, it was the fact that dead bodies (not to be confused with undead bodies) rarely presented themselves so conveniently for burial.
        \n\n
        There was a time when Yorick would have questioned this, when he would have tried to identify the cadaver, speak with its family, ensure its name and some pertinent trivia were etched into its tombstone. Now he simply plunged his shovel into the soil, happy to be done with the ghost of curiosity.
        \n\n
        With each passing shovel-full, Yorick felt a growing sense of remorse. In some ways he was enchanted by it. Emotions were the liquor of the living. As one crosses his third or fourth century of undeath, the memory of emotions becomes so faded that one wonders why he cares to remember them at all. This is where the disconnect between warmskins and the undead occurs. A gravedigger has a schedule to maintain and warmskins are just so deliriously attached to their lives, even despite decades of preparation for the inevitable. It is, after all, the inevitable.
        \n\n
        Yorick had tried to compromise once or twice, burying people alive so they could savor their precious lives to the very last moment, but that was generally twice the headache and nobody ever appreciated his efforts.
        \n\n
        By the time he'd dug the plot, Yorick's mind swam with somber anticipation. For reasons he couldn't fathom, this burial meant something. He simultaneously wished it could last forever and that he could be done with it already.
        \n\n
        The latter felt more practical. He heaved the body unceremoniously into its plot, then clambered down to refold the arms and arrange it with some semblance of dignity. There was something eerily familiar about it. All the faces he'd buried – the countless faces – bled into each other by this point, why was this one different?
        \n\n
        He climbed out of the hole and stared down at it one last time. He hadn't wondered about the life of one of his wards in centuries, but he couldn't help but feel a sense of unfulfilled purpose radiating from this one. Just as he was ready to pile the earth back atop the grave, he slipped. The shovel clattered into the hole.
        \n\n
        Yorick hadn't lost grip of his shovel...ever. Panicked, he chased after it, but he slipped again. The soil he'd mounded next to the grave started to slide in on its own, an unprovoked avalanche. Yorick tried frantically to hold it back, but it flowed past him unhindered. He glanced down and it finally came to him.
        \n\n
        The shovel rested neatly atop the body, clasped beneath its folded arms. The face -- that face he should have known -- was his own. It was the face of innocence, hope, sadness. It was a face so early on its journey, already convinced it had seen the end.
        \n\n
        And Yorick didn't even recognize it.
        \n\n
        The soil was falling in a torrent now, it had completely obscured the body and the last bits of the face were disappearing. Yorick dove into the hole and began tearing the dirt frantically. The motion was alien; he was completely lost without his shovel.
        \n\n
        When the last grain of soil stopped, Yorick was buried to his elbows.
        \n\n
        He hadn't felt anything – let alone this unyielding sadness – so acutely since he could remember.
        \n\n
        "Why do you want to join the League, Yorick?"
        \n\n
        He looked up. A man stood over him in a robe, some sort of mage. The face was concealed.
        \n\n
        "Who are you?" Yorick asked.
        \n\n
        "I'm employed by the League of Legends, that's all you need to know."
        \n\n
        "I don't care about your League now. I just want that body."
        \n\n
        "The body isn't real. It's forged from your memory. A mirage. Normally, I would stand here wearing the face of someone you once knew, but it seems you've forgotten everyone."
        \n\n
        Yorick thought about this. It could only be true.
        \n\n
        "Why do you want to join the League?" The man persisted.
        \n\n
        "I want to do... something else. I want to remember... and be remembered." Yorick felt like something was guiding his tongue. There was water on his face.
        \n\n
        What is this? What's happening?
        \n\n
        "We can provide that opportunity, Yorick, but we need to know some things from you." The voice never faltered.
        \n\n
        "About what?"
        \n\n
        "About where you come from."
        \n\n
        "I don't remember."
        \n\n
        "Not where you were born. I'm referring to the Shadow Isles." Yorick let the words hang in the air.
        \n\n
        "Very well."
        \n\n
        "How does it feel, exposing your mind?"
        \n\n
        The man was gone before Yorick could answer. Yorick felt truly alone, yet somewhere on the fringe of his awareness, excited. This League of Legends would soon taste the allure of death.

    <Story>
      Ziggs was born with a talent for tinkering, but his chaotic, hyperactive nature was unusual among yordle scientists. Aspiring to be a revered inventor like Heimerdinger, he rattled through ambitious projects with manic zeal, emboldened by both his explosive failures and his unprecedented discoveries. Word of Ziggs' volatile experimentation reached the famed Yordle Academy in Piltover and its esteemed professors invited him to demonstrate his craft. His characteristic disregard for safety brought the presentation to an early conclusion, however, when the hextech engine Ziggs was demonstrating overheated and exploded, blowing a huge hole in the wall of the Academy. The professors dusted themselves off and sternly motioned for him to leave. Devastated, Ziggs prepared to return to Bandle City in shame. However, before he could leave, a group of Zaunite agents infiltrated the Academy and kidnapped the professors. The Piltover military tracked the captives to a Zaunite prison, but their weapons were incapable of destroying the fortified walls. Determined to outdo them, Ziggs began experimenting on a new kind of armament, and quickly realized that he could harness his accidental gift for demolition to save the captured yordles.
      \n\n
      Before long, Ziggs had created a line of powerful bombs he lovingly dubbed ''hexplosives.'' With his new creations ready for their first trial, Ziggs traveled to Zaun and sneaked into the prison compound. He launched a gigantic bomb at the prison and watched with glee as the explosion tore through the reinforced wall. Once the smoke had cleared, Ziggs scuttled into the facility, sending guards running with a hail of bombs. He rushed to the cell, blew the door off its hinges, and led the captive yordles to freedom. Upon returning to the Academy, the humbled professors recognized Ziggs with an honorary title - Dean of Demolitions - and proposed that he demonstrate this new form of yordle ingenuity in the League of Legends. Vindicated at last, Ziggs accepted the proposal, eager to bring his ever-expanding range of hexplosives to the greatest testing grounds in the world: the Fields of Justice.

    <Story>In the wastelands of Urtistan, there was once a great city. It perished long ago in a terrible Rune War, like most of the lands below the Great Barrier. Nevertheless, one man survived: a sorcerer named Zilean. Being obsessed with time, it was only fitting that he dwelled in the city's Clock Tower. As the havoc of the war neared his home, Zilean experimented with powerful temporal magic to divine all possible futures, hoping to discover a peaceful solution. But Zilean's enchantments affected his perception of the passage of time, and he was in a contemplative stasis when Urtistan was set upon by an entire phalanx of dark summoner-knights of unknown affiliation. By the time he realized his error, Urtistan was nothing more than smoldering debris. The summoners who were responsible for its destruction had wisely left the Clock Tower unharmed, both to avoid drawing Zilean's attention and to torment him for his oversight.\n\nZilean barely had time to grieve the momentous loss before he learned that his dangerous research had a cruel side effect: chrono-displasia. This mystical disease granted him immortality, but detached his consciousness from its anchor in the present time. He now mentally drifts through time, from any point he has already lived to the present, unable to impact the events which unfold. The most torturous aspect of this curse is that Zilean sometimes experiences Urtistan as it once was and the rest of the time resides in its lonely ruins. Only the powerful summoning magic employed by members of the League of Legends has been able to treat this condition, and Zilean has joined in hopes of finding a cure, and thereafter a way to save his people.\n\n''There is no greater grief than for a loss that is yet to come.''\n - Zilean\n</Story>

    <Story>
      Longing to take control of her fate, the ancient, dying plant Zyra transferred her consciousness into a human body for a second chance at life. Centuries ago, she and her kind dominated the Plague Lands, using thorns and vines to consume any animal that set foot in their territory. As the years passed, the animal population steadily died off. Food became increasingly scarce, and Zyra could only stand by helplessly as the last of her kin withered away. She thought she would perish alone, until the appearance of an unwary sorceress presented her with an opportunity for salvation.
      \n\n
      It was the first time in years Zyra had sensed a creature wander so close. Hunger drew her to the sorceress, but some other, deeper instinct compelled her. She enveloped the woman in thorns with ease, but as she savored this final meal, foreign memories invaded her thoughts. She saw great jungles of metal and stone where humans and animals thrived. Potent magic surged through her vines, and she devised an elegant but risky plan to survive. Using the woman’s memories, Zyra poured her newfound magic into the creation of a human-shaped vessel. She didn’t know what sort of world awaited her, but she had nothing left to lose. When Zyra opened her eyes, she was overwhelmed by the raw power ready at her fingertips. It wasn’t until she noticed the shriveled remains of the plant she once was that she realized how vulnerable she had become. If this body died, there would be no network of vines to retreat through, no roots to regrow her...but she felt truly alive. She beheld the world for the first time as animals did, and a dark smile crept across her lips. She was reborn, and there was so much now within her grasp.
