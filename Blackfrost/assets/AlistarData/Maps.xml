  <Map name="Crystal Scar" mode="DOMINION" teamSize="5" description="Crystal Scar is the flagship map for the Dominion game mode, a frenetic 5v5 capture-and-hold battle that forgoes direct assault on the nexuses in exchange for the dispute of five capture points spaced evenly around the map. This mode promotes a much faster pace of play and consequentially features a different set of available items, map-wide buffs, and other adjustments." />
  <Map name="Proving Grounds" mode="CLASSIC" teamSize="5" description="The Proving Grounds is a 5v5 map created by a team lead by Brackhar during Riot Games' inaugural &quot;Thunder Dome&quot; event. This single-lane map is commonly played as an all-random map, and just as in Summoner's Rift and Twisted Treeline, the game only ends when the enemy Nexus is destroyed." />
  <Map name="Summoner's Rift" mode="CLASSIC" teamSize="5" description="Summoner's Rift, the first Field of Justice released, defines the classic League of Legends experience. Featuring a three-laned map styled after Warcraft III: Defense of the Ancients, Summoner's Rifts pits two teams of five summoners against one another in a strategic battle that ends when one team's nexus is destroyed." />
  <Map name="Twisted Treeline" mode="CLASSIC" teamSize="3" description="Twisted Treeline is a successor to Summoner's Rift designed for two teams of 3. With similar gameplay goals - the first and foremost of which is to destroy the opposing nexus - Twisted Treeline preserves the style of Summoner's Rift in a reduced size that caters to a more intimate 3v3 battle." />
